<h3>I</h3>

<h2>THE TALLYHO</h2>


<p>&quot;I never saw a gold mine in my life; and
now I'm going to see one,&quot; cried Lucy, skipping
along in advance of the others. It was
quite a large party; the whole Dunlee family,
with the two Sanfords,&mdash;Uncle James and
Aunt Vi,&mdash;making ten in all, counting Maggie,
the maid. They had alighted from the cars
at a way-station, and were walking along the
platform toward the tallyho coach which was
waiting for them. Lucy was firmly impressed
with the idea that they were starting for the
gold mines. The truth was, they were on
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2" />their way to an old mining-town high up in
the Cuyamaca Mountains, called Castle Cliff;
but there had been no gold there for a great
many years.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee was in rather poor health, and
had been &quot;ordered&quot; to the mountains. The
others were perfectly well and had not been
&quot;ordered&quot; anywhere: they were going merely
because they wanted to have a good time.</p>

<p>&quot;Papa would be so lonesome without us
children,&quot; said Edith, &quot;he needs us all for
company.&quot;</p>

<p>He was to have still more company. Mr.
and Mrs. Hale were coming to-morrow to
join the party, bringing their little daughter
Barbara, Lucy's dearest friend. They could
not come to-day; there would have been
hardly room for them in the tallyho. With all
&quot;the bonnie Dunlees,&quot;&mdash;as Uncle James called
the children,&mdash;and all the boxes, baskets, and
<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3" />bundles, the carriage was about as full as it
could hold.</p>

<p>It was seldom that the driver used this tallyho.
He was quite choice of it, and generally
drove an old stage, unless, as happened
just now, he was taking a large party. It was
a very gay tallyho, as yellow as the famous
pumpkin coach of Cinderella, only that the
spokes of the wheels were striped off with
scarlet. There were four white horses, and
every horse sported two tiny American flags,
one in each ear.</p>

<p>&quot;All aboard!&quot; called out the driver, a
brown-faced, broad-shouldered man, with a
twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&quot;All aboard!&quot; responded Mr. Sanford,
echoed by Jimmy-boy.</p>

<p>Whereupon crack went the driver's long
whip, round went the red and yellow wheels,
and off sped the white horses as freely as if
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4" />they were thinking of Lucy's gold mine and
longing to show it to her, and didn't care how
many miles they had to travel to reach it.
But this was all Lucy's fancy. They were
thinking of oats, not gold mines. These bright
horses knew they were not going very far up
the mountain. They would soon stop to rest
in a good stable, and other horses not so
handsome would take their places. It was a
very hard road, and grew harder and harder,
and the driver always changed horses twice
before he got to the end of the journey.</p>

<p>As the tallyho rattled along, the older people
in it fell to talking; and the children looked
at the country they were passing, sang
snatches of songs, and gave little exclamations
of delight. Edith threw one arm around her
older sister Katharine, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;O Kyzie, aren't you glad you live in California?
How sweet the air is, and how high
<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5" />the mountains look all around! When we
were East last summer didn't you pity the
people? Only think, they never saw any
lemons and oranges growing! They don't
know much about roses either; they only
have roses once a year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true,&quot; replied Kyzie. &quot;Let me
button your gloves, Edy, you'll be dropping
them off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See those butterflies! I'd be happy if Bab
was only in here,&quot; murmured a little voice
from under Lucy's hat. &quot;Bab didn't want to
come with her papa and mamma; she wanted
to come with <i>me</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Lucy, don't be foolish,&quot; said Edith.
&quot;Where could we have put Bab? There's
not room enough in this coach, unless one of
the rest of us had got out. You'll see Bab
to-morrow, and she'll be in Castle Cliff all
summer; so you needn't complain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6" /><i>I</i> wasn't complaining, no indeed! Only I
don't want to go down in the gold mine till
Bab comes. I s'pose they'll put us down in
a bucket, won't they? I want Uncle James
to go with us.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy-boy laughed and threw himself about
in quite a gale. He often found his little
sister very amusing.</p>

<p>&quot;Excuse me, Lucy,&quot; said he; &quot;but I do
think you're very ignorant! That mine up
there is all played out, and Uncle James has
told us so ever so many times. Didn't you
hear him? The shaft is more than half full
of muddy water. I'd like to see you going
down in a bucket!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then, Jimmy Dunlee, what <i>shall</i> we
do at Castle Cliff?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We've brought a tent with us, and for one
thing I'm going to camp out,&quot; replied Jimmy.
&quot;That's a grand thing, they say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7" />Don't! There'll be something come and
eat you up, sure as you live,&quot; said Lucy, who
had a vague notion that camping out was connected
in some way with wild animals, such
as coyotes and mountain lions.</p>

<p>&quot;Poh! you don't know the least thing
about Castle Cliff, Lucy! And Uncle James
has talked and talked! Tell me what he said,
now do.&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle James was seated nearly opposite,
for the two long seats of the tallyho faced
each other. Lucy spoke in a low tone, not
wishing him to overhear.</p>

<p>&quot;He said we were going to board at a big
house pretty near the old mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Mr. Templeton's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And he said somebody had a white Spanish
rabbit with reddish brown eyes and its
mouth all a-quiver.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I heard him say that about the rab<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" />bit.
And what are those things that come
and walk on top of the house in the morning?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. They are woodpeckers. They
tap on the roof, and the noise sounds like
'Jacob, Jacob, wake up, Jacob!' Uncle James
says when strangers hear it they think somebody
is calling, and they say, 'Oh, yes, we're
coming!' I shan't say that; I shall know it's
woodpeckers. Tell some more, Jimmy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes&quot; said Eddo, leaving Maggie and
wedging himself between Lucy and Jimmy.
&quot;Tell some more, Jimmum!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there's a post-office in town and
there's a telephone, and Mr. Templeton has
lots of things brought up to Castle Cliff from
the city; so we shall have plenty to eat;
chicken and ice-cream and things. That
makes me think, I'm hungry. Wouldn't they
let us open a luncheon basket?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" />Kyzie thought not; so Jimmy went on
telling Lucy what he knew of Castle Cliff.
&quot;It's named for an air-castle there is up there;
it's a thing they <i>call</i> an air-castle anyway. A
man built it in the hollow of some trees, away
up, up, up. I'm going to climb up there to
see it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So'm I,&quot; said Lucy.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho, you can't climb worth a cent; you're
only a girl!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she has an older brother; and sometimes
older brothers are kind enough to help
their little sisters,&quot; remarked Kyzie, with a
meaning smile toward Jimmy; but Jimmy was
looking another way.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle James told a funny story about
that air-castle,&quot; went on Kyzie. &quot;Did you
hear him tell of sitting up there one day and
seeing a little toad help another toad&mdash;a lame
one&mdash;up the trunk of the tree?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" />No, I didn't hear,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;How did
the toad do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll let you all guess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pushed him?&quot; said Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Took him up pickaback,&quot; suggested Lucy.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing of the sort. He just took his
friend's lame foot in his mouth, and the two
toads hopped along together! Uncle James
said it probably wasn't the first time, for they
kept step as if they were used to it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't that cunning?&quot; said Edith. And
Jimmy remarked after a pause, &quot;If Lucy
wants to go up to that castle, maybe I could
steady her along; only there's Bab. She'd
have to go too. And I don't believe it's any
place for girls!&quot;</p>

<p>The ride was a long one, forty miles at least.
The passengers had dinner at a little inn, the
elegant horses were placed in a stable; and the
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" />tallyho started again at one o'clock with a black
horse, a sorrel horse, and two gray ones.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore on. The horses climbed
upward at every step; and though the journey
was delightful, the passengers were growing
rather tired.</p>

<p>&quot;Wish I could sit on the seat with the
king-ductor,&quot; besought little Eddo, moving
about uneasily.</p>

<p>&quot;That isn't a conductor, it's a driver. Conductors
are the men that go on the steam-cars,&mdash;the
'choo choo cars,'&quot; explained Jimmum.
Then in a lower tone, &quot;They don't have any
cars up at Castle Cliff, and I'm glad of it.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy did not understand why he should be
glad, and Jimmy added in a lower tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Because&mdash;don't you remember how some
little folks used to act about steam-engines?
They might do it again, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I 'member now. But that was a
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" />long time ago, Jimmy. He wouldn't run after
engines now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who wouldn't?&quot; inquired young Master
Eddo, forgetting the &quot;king-ductor&quot; and turning
about to face his elder brother. &quot;Who
wouldn't run after the engine, Jimmum?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nobody&mdash;I mean <i>you</i> wouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, not me,&quot; assented Eddo, shaking
his flaxen head.</p>

<p>And there the matter would have ended, if
Lucy had not added most unluckily: &quot;'Twas
when you were only a baby that you did it,
Eddo. You said to the engine, 'Come here,
little choo choo, Eddo won't hurt oo.' <i>You</i>
didn't know any better.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>'Course</i> I knew better,&quot; said Eddo, shaking
his head again, but this time with an air
of bewilderment. &quot;<i>I</i> didn't say, 'Come here,
little choo choo.' No, no, not me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but you did, darling,&quot; persisted Lucy.<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" />
&quot;You were just a tiny bit of a boy. You
stood right on the track, and the engine was
coming, 'puff, puff,' and you said, 'Come
here, little choo choo, Eddo won't hurt oo!'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't! Oh! Oh! Oh! <i>When'd</i> I say
that? <i>Did</i> the engine hurt me? <i>Where</i> did it
hurt me? Say, Jimmum, where did the engine
hurt me?&quot; putting his hand to his throat, to
his ears, to his side.</p>

<p>The more he thought of it, the worse he
felt; till appalled by the idea of what he
must have suffered he finally fell to sobbing
in his mother's arms, and she soothed his
imaginary woes with kisses and cookies. For
the remainder of the journey he was in pretty
good spirits and found much diversion in
watching the gambols of the two dogs following
the tallyho. One was a Castle Cliff dog,
black and shaggy, named Slam; the other,
yellow and smooth, belonged to the &quot;king-<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" />ductor&quot;
or driver, and was called Bang. Slam
and Bang often darted off for a race and
Eddo nearly gave them up for lost; but they
always came back wagging their tails and
capering about as if to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Eddo, we ran away just to scare
you, and we'll do it again if we please!&quot;</p>

<p>It was a great day for dogs. Ever so many
dogs ran out to meet Slam and Bang. They
always bit their ears for a &quot;How d'ye do?&quot;
and then trotted along beside them just for
company. Eddo found it quite exciting. One
was a Mexican dog, without a particle of hair,
but he did not seem to be in the least
ashamed of his singular appearance.</p>

<p>Edith said it was an &quot;empty country,&quot; and
indeed there were few houses; but there must
have been more dogs than houses, for the
whole journey had a running accompaniment
of &quot;bow-wow-wows.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" />The farther up hill the road wound the
steeper it grew; and Jimmy exclaimed more
than once:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;This coach is standing up straight on its
hind feet, papa! Just look! 'Twill spill us
all out backward!&quot;</p>

<p>But it did nothing of the sort. It took them
straight to Castle Cliff, &quot;nearly six thousand
feet above the level of the sea,&quot; and there
it stopped, before the front door of the hotel.
It was about half-past five o'clock in the
afternoon, and Mr. Templeton, who had been
looking out for the tallyho, came down the
steps to meet his guests.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="II" id="II" /><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" />II</h3>

<h2>THE FIRST DINNER</h2>


<p>Mr. Templeton's wife was just behind
him. They both greeted the party as if they
had all been old friends. The house, a large
white one, stood as if in the act of climbing
the hill. In front was a sloping lawn full
of brilliant flowers, bordered with house-leek,
or &quot;old hen and chickens,&quot; a plant running
over with pink blossoms. Kyzie had not
expected to see a garden like this on the
mountain.</p>

<p>At one side of the house, between two
black oak trees, was a hammock, and near
it a large stone trough, into which water
dripped from a faucet. Two birds, called
red-hammers, were sipping the water with
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" />their bills, not at all disturbed by the arrival
of strangers.</p>

<p>It was a small settlement. The hotel, by
far the largest house in Castle Cliff, looked
down with a grand air upon the few cottages
in sight. These tiny cottages were not at all
pretty, and had no grass or lawns in front,
but people from the city were keeping house in
them for the summer; and besides there were
tents scattered all about, full of &quot;campers.&quot;</p>

<p>As the &quot;bonnie Dunlees&quot; and their elders
entered the hotel, a merry voice called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;A hearty welcome to you, my friends,
and three cheers for Castle Cliff!&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Dunlee and the Sanfords
walked on smiling, and the children lingered
awhile outside; but it was a full minute
before any of them discovered that the
cheery voice belonged to a parrot, whose
cage swung from a tall sycamore overhead.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" />Polly's pretty sociable,&quot; laughed Mr. Templeton.
&quot;Do you like animals, young ladies?
If so, please stand up here in a group, and
you shall have another welcome.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he clapped his hands and called out
&quot;Thistleblow!&quot; and immediately a pretty red
pony came frisking along and began to caper
around the young people with regular dancing
steps, making at the same time the most
graceful salaams, pausing now and then to
sway himself as if he were courtesying. It
was a charming performance. The little
creature had once belonged to a band of
gypsies, who had given him a regular course
of training.</p>

<p>&quot;He is trying to tell you how glad he is
to see you,&quot; said Mr. Templeton, as the children
shouted and clapped their hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, won't Bab like it, though!&quot; cried
Lucy. &quot;Seems as if I couldn't wait till
<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" />to-morrow for Bab to get here, for then the
good times will begin.&quot;</p>

<p>But for Kyzie and Edith and Jimmy the
good times had begun already. The five
Dunlees entered the house, little Eddo clinging
fast to Jimmum's forefinger. They
passed an old lady who sat on the veranda
knitting. She gazed after them through her
spectacles, and said to Mr. Templeton in a
tone of inquiry:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Boarders?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, rubbing his chin, &quot;and
they have lots of jingle in 'em too; they're
just the kind I like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I hope they won't get into any
mischief up here, that's all I've got to say.
Nobody wants to take children to board
anyway, but you can't always seem to help
it.&quot;</p>

<p>And then the old lady turned to her knit<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" />ting
again; indeed her fingers had been flying
all the while she talked. Mr. Templeton
looked at her curiously, and wondered if she
disliked children.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd as lief have 'em 'round the house as
her birds and kittens anyway,&quot; he reflected;
for she kept a magpie, three cats and a canary;
and these pets had not been always
agreeable guests at the hotel.</p>

<p>It was now nearly six o'clock, and savory
odors from the kitchen mingled with the
balmy breath of the flowers stealing in from
the lawn. The Dunlee party had barely time
for hasty toilets when the gong sounded for
dinner. The Templeton dining-room was large
and held several tables. The Dunlees had
the longest of these, the one near the west
window. There were twelve plates set, though
only nine were needed to-night. The three
extra plates had been placed there for the<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" />
Hale family, who were expected to-morrow.
Mrs. Dunlee had told the landlord that she
would like the Hales at her table.</p>

<p>&quot;And Bab will sit side o' me,&quot; said Lucy.
&quot;Oh, won't we be happy?&quot;</p>

<p>As the Dunlees took their seats to-night
and looked around the room they saw a droll
sight. The old lady, who had been knitting
on the veranda, was seated at a small table
in one corner; and on each side of her in a
chair sat a cat! One cat was a gray &quot;coon,&quot;
the other an Angora; and both of them sat
up as grave as judges, nibbling bits of cheese.
Mrs. McQuilken herself, dressed in a very
odd style, was knitting again. She was a remarkably
industrious woman, and as it would
be perhaps three or four minutes before the
soup came in, she could not bear to waste the
time in idleness. Her head-dress was odd
enough. It was just a strip of white muslin
<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" />wound around the head like an East Indian
puggaree. Mrs. McQuilken had many outlandish
fashions. She was the widow of a
sea-captain and had been abroad most of her
life. The children could hardly help staring
at her. Even after they had learned to know
her pretty well they still wanted to stare; and
not being able to remember her name they
spoke of her as &quot;the knitting-woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look, Lucy,&quot; whispered Jimmy; &quot;there's
a boy I know over there at that little table.
It's Nate Pollard.&quot;</p>

<p>He waved his hand toward him and Nate
waved in reply. At home Jimmy had not
known Nate very well, for he was older than
himself and in higher classes; but here among
strangers Jimmy-boy was glad to see a familiar
face. Mr. and Mrs. Pollard were with their
son. Perhaps they had all come for the summer.
Jimmy hoped so.</p>

<p><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" />There were two colored servants gliding
about the room, and a pretty waiting-maid.</p>

<p>&quot;O dear, no cook from Cathay,&quot; whispered
Kyzie to Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what you mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean I wanted a cook from Cathay or
Cipango,&quot; went on Kyzie, laughing behind her
napkin.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going to shake you,&quot; said Edith, who
suddenly bethought herself that Cathay and
Cipango were the old names for China and
Japan. This had been part of her history
lesson a few days ago. How Kyzie did remember
everything!</p>

<p>At that moment the colored man from
Georgia stood at her elbow with a steaming
plate of soup. Lucy looked at him askance.
Why couldn't he have been a Chinaman with
a pigtail? She had told Bab she was almost
sure there would be a &quot;China cook&quot; at the
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" />mountains, and when he passed the soup he
would say, &quot;Have soup-ee?&quot; Bab had been
in Europe and in Maine and in California,
but knew very little of Chinamen and had
often said she &quot;wanted to eat China cooking.&quot;</p>

<p>The dinner was excellent. Eddo enjoyed
it very much for a while; then his head
began to nod over his plate, his spoon waved
uncertainly in the air, and Maggie had to be
sent for to take him away from the table.</p>

<p>The ride up the mountain had been so
fatiguing that by eight o'clock all the Dunlees,
little and big, were glad to find themselves
snugly in bed. They slept late, every
one of them, and even the woodpeckers, tapping
on the roof next morning, failed to arouse
them with their &quot;Jacob, Jacob, wake up,
wake up, Jacob!&quot;</p>

<p>After breakfast Edith happened to leave
the dining-room just behind Mrs. McQuilken,
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" />who held her two cats cuddled up in her
arms like babies, and was kissing their foreheads
and calling them &quot;mamma's precious
darlings.&quot; As Edith heard this she could
not help smiling, and Mrs. McQuilken paused
in the entry a moment to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess you like cats.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, ma'am. Oh, yes, very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. I like to see children fond
of animals. Now, I've got a new kitty upstairs,
a zebra kitty, that you'd be pleased
with. It's a beauty, and <i>such</i> a tail! Come
up to my room and see it if you want to.
My room's Number Five. But don't you
come now; I shall be busy an hour and a
half. Remember, an hour and a half.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith thanked her and ran to tell Kyzie
what the &quot;knitting-woman&quot; had been saying.</p>

<p>&quot;Go get your kodak,&quot; said Kyzie. &quot;Nate
Pollard is going to take us all out on an
<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" />exploring expedition. You know he has been
in Castle Cliff a whole week, and knows
the places.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First thing I want to see is that mine,&quot;
said Lucy, as they all met outside the hotel.</p>

<p>&quot;The mine?&quot; repeated Kyzie, and looked
at Eddo. &quot;I'm afraid it isn't quite safe to
take little bits of people to such a place as
that. Do you think it is, Nate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rather risky,&quot; replied Nate.</p>

<p>Eddo had caught the words, &quot;little bits of
people,&quot; and his eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>&quot;What does <i>mine</i> mean, Jimmum?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A great big hole, I guess. See here,
Eddo, let's go in the house and find Maggie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; chimed in Edith, &quot;let's go find
Maggie. There's a <i>beau</i>-tiful picture book in
mamma's drawer. You just ask Maggie and
she'll show you the picture of those nice
little guinea-pigs.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" />Though very young, Eddo was acute enough
to see through this little manoeuvre. It was
not the first time the other children had tried
to get him out of the way. They wanted to
go to see a charming &quot;great big hole&quot; somewhere,
and they thought he would fall into
it and get hurt. They were always thinking
such things&mdash;so stupid of them! They
thought he used to run after &quot;choo choos&quot;
and talk to them, when of course he never
did it; 'twas some other little boy.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to go with Jimmum,&quot; said he,
stoutly. &quot;You ought to not go 'thout me!
<i>I</i> shan't talk to that mine. <i>I</i> shan't say,
'Come, little mine, Eddo won't hurt oo.' No,
no, not me! I shan't say nuffin', and I
shan't fall in the hole needer. So there!
H'm! 'm! 'm!&quot;</p>

<p>It was not easy to resist his pleading.
Perhaps Aunt Vi saw how matters were, for
<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" />she appeared just then, bearing the news that
she and Uncle James were going to drive,
and would like to take one of the children.</p>

<p>&quot;And Eddo is the one we want. He is
so small that he can sit on the seat between
us. Aren't the rest of you willing to give
him up just for this morning? He can go
to walk with you another time.&quot;</p>

<p>So they all said they would try to give
him up, and he bounded away with Aunt
Vi, his dear little face beaming with proud
satisfaction.</p>

<h2>LUCY'S GOLD MINE</h2>


<p>The other children strolled leisurely along
toward a place that looked like a long strip
of sand.</p>

<p>&quot;A sand beach,&quot; said Kyzie.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Nate; &quot;it isn't a beach and it
isn't sand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What <i>can</i> you mean? What else is it,
pray?&quot;</p>

<p>She stooped and took up a handful of something
that certainly looked like sand. The
others did the same.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you call that?&quot; they all asked,
as they sifted it through their fingers.</p>

<p>Nate smiled in a superior way.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" />Well, I don't call it sand, because it isn't
sand. I thought it was when I first saw it;
I got cheated, same as you. But there's no
sand to it; it's just <i>tailings</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What in the world is tailings?&quot; asked
Kyzie, taking up another handful and looking
it over very carefully. Strange if she, a
girl in her teens, couldn't tell sand when she
saw it! But she politely refrained from making
any more remarks, and waited for Nate
to answer her question. He was an intelligent
boy, between eleven and twelve.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, tailings are just powdered rocks,&quot;
said Nate.</p>

<p>&quot;Powdered rocks? Who powdered them?
What for?&quot; asked Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, the miners did it years ago. They
ground up the rocks in the mine into powder
just as fine as they could, and then washed
the powder to get the gold out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" />Oh, I see,&quot; said Edith. &quot;So these tailings
are what's left after the gold's washed out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, they brought 'em and spread 'em
'round here to get rid of 'em I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the gold all washed out, every bit?&quot;
asked Jimmy. &quot;Seems as if I could see a
little shine to it now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they got out all they could. There
may be a little dust of it left though. Mr.
Templeton says the folks in 'Frisco that own
the mine think there's <i>some</i> left, and the tailings
ought to be sent to San Diego and
worked over.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy took up another handful. Yes,
there was a faint shine to it; it began to
look precious.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there's a heap of it anyway. It
goes ever so far down,&quot; said he, thrusting in
a stick.</p>

<p>&quot;It's from ten to twelve feet deep,&quot; re<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" />plied
Nate, proud of his knowledge; &quot;and
see how long and wide!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>I</i> don't see how they ever ground up rocks
so fine,&quot; said Kyzie. &quot;Exactly like sand.
And it stretches out so far that you'd think
'twas a sand beach by the sea,&mdash;only there
isn't any sea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's just as good as a beach anyway,&quot;
said Nate. &quot;Just as good for picnics
and the like of that. When there's
anything going on, they get out the brass
band and have fireworks and bring chairs
and benches and sit round here. I tell you
it's great!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are lots of benches here now,&quot;
remarked Edith. &quot;And what's that long
wooden thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a staging. That's where they have
the brass band sit; that's where they send up
the fireworks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" />Oh, I hope they'll have fireworks while
we're here, and picnics.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course they will. They're always having
'em. And I heard somebody say they're
talking of a barbecue.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith clapped her hands. She did not know
what a barbecue might be, but it sounded wild
and jolly.</p>

<p>&quot;What a long stretch of mud-puddle right
here by the tailings,&quot; said Kyzie.</p>

<p>Nate laughed. &quot;It <i>is</i> a damp spot, that's
a fact!&quot;</p>

<p>They all wondered what he was laughing
at. &quot;I guess there used to be water here
once,&quot; said Jimmy at a venture. &quot;There's
water here now standing round in spots.
And,&mdash;why, it's <i>fishes</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy stooped all of a sudden and picked
up a dead fish.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh! I never caught a fish before!&quot;<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" />
But next moment she threw it away in disgust.</p>

<p>&quot;How did dead fishes ever get into this
mud-puddle?&quot; queried Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they used to live in it before it dried
up,&quot; replied Nate. &quot;Fact is, this is a <i>lake</i>!&quot;</p>

<p>Everybody exclaimed in surprise; and Kyzie
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't seem possible; but then things
are so queer up here that you can believe
almost anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really it is a lake. It's all right in the
winter, and swells tremendously then; but this
is a dry year, you know, and it's all dried
up.&quot; Kyzie forgave the lake for drying up,
but pitied the fishes. Edith thought Castle
Cliff was &quot;a funny place anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What little bits of houses! Did they dry
up too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, those are just the cabins and bunk-<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" />houses
that were built for the miners, ever so
long ago when the mine was going. Fixed
up into cottages now for summer boarders.
Do you want to see the mine?&quot;</p>

<p>They went around behind the shaft-house
and beyond the old saw-mill.</p>

<p>&quot;O my senses!&quot; cried Edith, &quot;is that the
old gold mine, that monstrous great thing?
Isn't it horrid?&quot;</p>

<p>They all agreed that it was &quot;perfectly awful
and dreadful,&quot; and that it made you shudder
to look into it; and that they were glad baby
Eddo was safely out of the way. The mine
was a deep, irregular chasm, full of dirty water
and rocks. It had a hungry, cruel look; you
could almost fancy it was waiting in wicked
glee to swallow up thoughtless little children.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't seem as if anybody could ever
have dug for gold in that horrid ditch,&quot;
exclaimed Kyzie.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" />You'd better believe they did, though,&quot;
said the young guide. &quot;They used to get it
out in nuggets, cart-loads of it.&quot;</p>

<p>He was not quite sure of the nuggets, but
liked the sound of the word.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, cart-loads of it. I tell you 'twas the
richest mine in the whole Cuyamaca Mountains.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad the gold gave out,&quot; said Kyzie,
gazing regretfully into the watery depths.</p>

<p>&quot;But it didn't give out! Why, there's gold
enough left down there to buy up the whole
United States! They lost the vein, that's
all&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The vein? What's a vein?&quot; asked Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see,&quot; replied the guide, &quot;gold
goes along underground in streaks; they call
it veins. The miners had to stop digging here
because they lost track of the streak. But
they'll find it again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" />How do <i>you</i> know?&quot; asked Jimmy-boy,
who thought Nate was putting on too many
airs.</p>

<p>&quot;Because Mr. Templeton said so. They've
sent for Colonel Somebody from I&mdash;forget
where. He's a splendid mining engineer, great
for finding lost veins. He'll be here next
week and bring a lot of men.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whoop-ee!&quot; cried Jimmy, &quot;he'll find the
vein and things, and we'll be having gold as
plenty as blackberries!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just what I was talking about yesterday
when you laughed,&quot; broke in Lucy. &quot;I said
I'd go down in a bucket; don't you know I
did?&quot;</p>

<p>Edith was gazing spellbound at the yawning
chasm.</p>

<p>&quot;Look at those rickety steps! The men
will get killed! 'Twill all cave in!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No danger,&quot; said Nate, &quot;there are walls
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" />down there, stone walls, papa says, that keep
it all safe.&quot;</p>

<p>He meant &quot;galleries,&quot; but had forgotten
the word.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't care if there are five hundred
stone walls, I guess the men could drown
all the same!&quot; said Edith. &quot;That water
ought to be let out, Nate Pollard! If the
colonel is coming next week why don't they
let out the water this very day and give the
place a chance to dry off.&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke in a tone of the gravest anxiety,
as if she understood the matter perfectly, and
felt the whole care of the mine. Indeed,
the mine had become suddenly very interesting
to all the children. It certainly looked
like a rough, wild, frightful hole; nothing
more than a hole; but if there were gold
down there in &quot;nuggets,&quot; why, that was
quite another matter; it became at once an
<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" />enchanted hole; it was as delightful as a
fairy story.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope it's true that they've sent for that
colonel,&quot; said Kyzie.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it's true,&quot; replied Nate, who
did not like to have his word doubted.</p>

<p>&quot;I s'pose there are buckets 'round here.
Oh, aren't you glad we came to Castle
Cliff?&quot; said Lucy, pirouetting around Jimmy.</p>

<p>&quot;Bab will be glad, too,&quot; she thought. For
Lucy never could look forward to any pleasure
without wishing her darling &quot;niece&quot; to
share it with her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess we've seen everything there
is to see,&quot; remarked Nate, who had now told
all he knew and was ready to go.</p>

<p>While they still wandered about, talking of
&quot;tailings&quot; and &quot;nuggets,&quot; they were startled
by the peal of a bell.</p>

<p>&quot;Twelve o'clock! Two minutes ahead of
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" />time though,&quot; said Nate, taking from his
pocket a handsome gold watch which Jimmy
had always admired.</p>

<p>&quot;What bell is that? Where is it?&quot; they
all asked. &quot;And what is it ringing for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's on top of the schoolhouse and it's
ringing for noon. 'Twill ring again in the
evening at nine o'clock. But I can tell 'em
they ought to set it back two minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A nine o'clock bell? Why, that's a <i>curfew</i>
bell! How romantic!&quot; cried Kyzie. She had
read of &quot;the mellow lin-lan-lone of evening
bells,&quot; but had never heard it. &quot;Let's go to
the schoolhouse.&quot;</p>

<p>As luncheon at the Templeton House would
not be served for an hour yet, they kept on
to the hollow where the schoolhouse stood.
It was a small, unpainted building in the
shade of three pine trees.</p>

<p>&quot;Just wait a minute right here,&quot; said Edith,
<a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" />the young artist, unstrapping her kodak. &quot;I
want a snap-shot at it. Stand there by that
tree, Jimmum. Put your foot out just so. I
wish you were barefooted!&quot;</p>

<p>Just then, as if they had overheard the wish,
two little boys came running down the hill, and
one of them was barefooted. Moreover, when
Kyzie asked if they would stand for a picture,
they consented at once.</p>

<p>&quot;My name's Joseph Rolfe,&quot; said the elder,
twitching off his hat, &quot;and his name,&quot;&mdash;pointing
to his companion with a chuckle,&mdash;&quot;his
name is Chicken Little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No such a thing! Now you quit!&quot;
retorted the younger lad in a choked voice,
digging his toes into the dirt, &quot;quit a-plaguing
me! My name's Henry Small and you know
it!&quot;</p>

<p>While Edith was busy taking their photographs,
Kyzie thanked the urchins very
<a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" />pleasantly. They both gazed at her with
admiration.</p>

<p>&quot;See here,&quot; said Joe Rolfe, twitching off his
hat again very respectfully, &quot;Are you going
to keep school in the schoolhouse? I wish you
would!&quot;</p>

<p>At this remarkable speech Jimmy and Edith
fell to laughing; but Kyzie only blushed a little,
and smiled. How very grown-up she must
seem to Joe if he could think of her as a
teacher! She was now a tall girl of fourteen,
with a fine strong face and an earnest manner.
She was beginning to tire of being classed
among little girls, and it was delightful to find
herself looked upon for the first time in her
life as a young lady. But she only said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, Joe, people don't teach school in
summer! Summer is vacation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but they do sometimes,&quot; persisted
Joe; &quot;there was a girl kep' this school last
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" />summer. She called it 'vacation school.' But
we didn't like her; she licked like fury.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So she did,&quot; echoed Chicken Little, &quot;licked
and pulled ears. Kep' a stick on the desk.&quot;</p>

<p>And with these last words both the little
boys took their leave, running up hill with
great speed, as if they thought that standing
for a picture had been a great waste of
time.</p>

<p>&quot;That Chicken boy is the biggest cry-baby,&quot;
said Nate. &quot;The boys like to plague him to
see him cry. Joe Rolfe has some sense.&quot;</p>

<p>As the little party walked on, Miss Katharine
turned her head more than once for another
look at the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>&quot;Wouldn't it be fun, Edy, to teach school
in there and ring that 'lin-lan-lone bell' to call
in the scholars? I'd make you study botany
harder'n you ever did before.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you, Miss Dunlee,&quot; replied<a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" />
Edith, courtesying. &quot;You'll not get me to
worrying over botany. I studied it a month
once, but when I go up in the mountains I
go to have a good time.&quot;</p>

<p>She pursed her pretty mouth as she spoke.
Her sister Katharine was by far the best
botanist in her class, and was always tearing
up flowers in the most wasteful manner.
Worse than that, she expected Edith to do the
same thing and learn the hard names of the
poor little withered pieces.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't love flowers as well as I do,
Kyzie, or you couldn't abuse them so!&quot;</p>

<p>This is what she often said to her learned
sister after Kyzie had made &quot;a little preach&quot;
about the beauties of botany.</p>

<p>As they entered the hotel for luncheon,
Kyzie was still thinking of the schoolhouse
and the sweet-toned bell and the singular
speech of Joe Rolfe, about wanting her for a
<a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" />teacher. What came of these thoughts you
shall hear later on.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I declare, I forgot all about that
zebra kitty,&quot; said Edith. &quot;What will the
knitting-woman think of such actions?&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV" /><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" />IV</h3>

<h2>THE &quot;KNITTING-WOMAN&quot;</h2>


<p>The &quot;knitting-woman&quot; met Edith at the
dining-room door after luncheon, and said to
her rather sharply:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, little girl, I thought you liked kittens?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do, Mrs.&mdash;madam, I certainly do,&quot; replied
Edith feeling guilty and ashamed. &quot;But
Nate Pollard took us to see the gold mine and
the schoolhouse and we've just got back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's it! I thought 'twas very still
around here&mdash;I missed the noise of the
<i>boyoes</i>.&mdash;You don't know what I mean by
boyoes,&quot; she added, smiling. &quot;I picked up
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" />the word in Ireland. I'm always picking up
words. It means <i>boys</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand; oh, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, 'twas a little trouble to me, your not
coming when I expected you; but you may
come this afternoon. I'll be ready in ten
minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, madam, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith ran to her mother laughing. &quot;Oh,
mamma, she is the queerest woman! Calls
boys <i>boyoes</i>! I must go to see her kitten
whether I want to or not&mdash;in just ten minutes!
I wish I could take Kyzie with me;
would you dare?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not. Katharine has not been
invited. And don't make a long call, Edith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mamma, I'll not even sit down. I'll
just look at the zebra kitty and come right
away.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee smiled. If there were many
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" />pets at Number Five it was not likely
that Edith would hasten away. &quot;Remember,
daughter, fifteen minutes is long enough
for a call on an entire stranger. You don't
wish to annoy Mrs. McQuilken; but if you
should happen to forget, you'll hear this
little bell tinkle, and that will remind you to
leave.&quot;</p>

<p>Number Five was a very interesting room,
about as full as it could hold of oddities
from various countries, together with four cats,
a canary, and a mocking-bird.</p>

<p>&quot;If you had come this morning you would
have seen Mag, that's the magpie,&quot; said Mrs.
McQuilken. &quot;She's off now, pretty creature.
She likes to be picking a fuss with the
chickens.&quot;</p>

<p>The good lady had been knitting, but she
dropped her work into the large pocket of
her black apron, and moved up an easy-chair
<a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" />for her guest. Edith forgot to take it. Her
eyes were roving about the room, attracted by
the curiosities, though she dared not ask a
single question.</p>

<p>&quot;That nest on the wall looks odd to you,
I dare say,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken. &quot;The
twigs are woven together so closely that it
looks nice enough for a lady's work-bag, now
doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>Edith said she thought it did.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's the magpie's nest. She laid
seven eggs in it once. I keep it now for her
to sleep in; it's Mag's cot-bed.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith's eyes, still roving, espied a handsome
kitty asleep on the lounge. It must be the
zebra kitty because of its black and dove-colored
stripes. Most remarkable stripes, so
regular and distinct, yet so softly shaded.
The face was black, with whiskers snow-white.
How odd! Edith had never seen white whis<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" />kers
on a kitten. And then the long, sweeping
black tail!</p>

<p>Mrs. McQuilken watched the little girl's
face and no longer doubted her fondness for
kittens.</p>

<p>&quot;I call her Zee for short. Look at that
now!&quot; And Mrs. McQuilken straightened
out the tail which was coiled around Zee's
back.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how beautifully long!&quot; cried Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Long? I should say so! There was a cat-show
at Los Angeles last fall, and one cat took
a prize for a tail not so long as this by three-quarters
of an inch! And Zee only six
months old!&quot;</p>

<p>The kitty, wide awake by this time, was
holding high revel with a ball of yarn which
the tortoise-shell cat had purloined from her
mistress's basket.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear thing! Oh, isn't she sweet?&quot; said<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" />
Edith, dropping on her knees before the
graceful creature.</p>

<p>Mrs. McQuilken enjoyed seeing the child
go off into small raptures; Edith was fast
winning her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Does your mother like cats?&quot; she suddenly
inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;Not particularly,&quot; replied Edith, clapping
her hands, as Zee with a quick dash bore away
the ball out of the very paws of the coon cat.
&quot;Mamma thinks cats are cold-hearted,&quot; said
she, hugging Zee to her bosom. &quot;She says
they don't love anybody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I deny it!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. McQuilken,
indignantly. &quot;Tell your mother to make a
study of cats and she'll know better.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith looked rather frightened. &quot;Yes'm,
I'll tell her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They have very deep feelings and folks ought
to know it. Now, listen, little girl. I had two
<a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" />maltese kittens once. They were sisters and
loved each other better than any girl sisters <i>you</i>
ever saw. One of the kittens got caught in a
trap and we had to kill her. And the other one
went round mewing and couldn't be comforted.
She pined away, that kitty did, and in three
days she died. Now I know that for a fact.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor child!&quot; said Edith, much touched.
&quot;<i>She</i> wasn't cold-hearted, I'll tell mamma
about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if she doesn't like 'em perhaps it
wouldn't do any good; but while you're about
it you might tell her of two tortoise-shell cats
I had. They were sisters too. Whiff had four
kittens and Puff had one and lost it. And the
way Whiff comforted Puff! She took her right
home into her own basket and they brought up
the four kittens together. Wasn't that lovely?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, wasn't it, though?&quot; said Edith. &quot;Cats
have hearts, I always knew they did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" />That shows you're a sensible little girl,&quot;
returned the old lady approvingly. &quot;But you
haven't told me yet what your name is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Edith Dunlee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew 'twas Dunlee&mdash;that's a Scotch
name; but I didn't know about the Edith.
Well, Edith, so you've been to see the gold
mine? Pokerish place, isn't it? I hear they're
going to bring down the engine from the big
plant and try to start it up again.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith had no idea what she meant by the
&quot;big plant,&quot; so made no reply. Mrs. McQuilken
went back to the subject of cats.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know the Egyptians used to
worship cats? Well, sometimes they did.
And when their cats died they went into
mourning for them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How queer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It does seem so, but it's just as you look
at it, Edith. Cats are a sight of company.<a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" />
I didn't care so much about them or about
birds either when my husband was alive and
my little children, but now&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Again she paused, and this time she did
not go on again. Some one out of doors
laughed; it was Jimmy Dunlee, and the mocking-bird
took up the merry sound and echoed
it to perfection.</p>

<p>&quot;Doesn't that seem human?&quot; cried Mrs.
McQuilken. And really it did. It was
exactly the laugh of a human boy, though
it came from the throat of a tiny bird.</p>

<p>&quot;My little boys, Pitt and Roscoe, liked to
hear him do that,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken.</p>

<p>Edith observed that she did not say &quot;my
boyoes.&quot; &quot;Pitt, the one that died in Japan,
doted on the mocking-bird. The other boy,
Roscoe, was all bound up in the canary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does the canary sing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he's a grand singer. Just you wait
<a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" />till he pipes up. You'll be surprised. But
you remember what I was saying a little
while ago about your mother? That zebra
kitty&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Before she could finish the sentence Edith
heard the warning tinkle of the tea-bell, and
sprang up suddenly, exclaiming: &quot;Good-by,
Mrs.&mdash;good-by, <i>madam</i>, I must go now.
You've been very kind, thank you. Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p>And out of the door and away she skipped,
leaving her hostess, who had not heard the
bell, to wonder at her haste. &quot;She went like
a shot off a shovel,&quot; said the good lady, taking
up her knitting-work. &quot;She seemed to
be such a well-mannered little girl, too! What
got into her all at once? She acted as if she
was 'possessed of the fox.'&quot;</p>

<p>This is a common expression in Japan, and
naturally Mrs. McQuilken had caught it up,
as she had caught up other odd things in her
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" />travels. She was something of a mocking-bird
in her way, was the captain's widow.</p>

<p>&quot;I've taken quite a fancy to Edith,&quot; she
added, &quot;a minute more and I should have
offered to give her the zebra kitty. But
there, I shouldn't want to make a fuss in the
family. That woman, her mother, to think
of her talking so hard about cats! She
doesn't <i>look</i> like that kind of a woman. I'm
surprised.&quot;</p>

<p>Edith ran back to her mother breathless.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mamma, I was having such a good
time! And she didn't appear to be 'annoyed,'
she talked just as fast all the time! But the
bell rang while she was saying something
and I had to run.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Had to run? I hope you were not
abrupt, my child?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, mamma, not at all. I said 'good-by'
twice, and thanked her and told her she
<a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" />had been very kind. That wasn't abrupt, was
it? But oh, that kitty's tail! I forget how
many inches and a quarter longer than any
other kitty's tail in this state! And they are
not cold-hearted,&mdash;I mean cats,&mdash;I promised
to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Here followed an account of the two cat-sisters,
who loved each other better than girl-sisters.</p>

<p>&quot;And think of one of them dying of grief,
the sweet thing! Human people don't die of
grief, do they, mamma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not often, Edith. Such instances have
been known, but they are very rare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; struck in wee Lucy, who had been
listening to the touching story, &quot;well, I guess
some folks would! Bab would die for grief
of me, and I would die for grief of Bab; we
<i>said</i> we would!&quot;</p>

<p>She made this absurd little speech with
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" />tears in her eyes; but Kyzie and Edith dared
not laugh, for mamma's forefinger was raised.
Mamma never allowed them to ridicule the
friendship of the two little girls, who had made
believe for more than a year that they were
&quot;aunt&quot; and &quot;niece.&quot; The play might be rather
foolish, but the love was very sweet and true.</p>

<p>Lucy had been thinking all day of Barbara
and longing for her arrival. A full hour
before it was time for the stage she went a
little way up the mountain with Jimmy, and
they took turns gazing down the winding,
dusty road through a spy-glass. &quot;I shan't
wait here any longer. What's the use?&quot;
declared Jimmy.</p>

<p>&quot;She's coming! she's coming! I saw her
first!&quot; was Lucy's glad cry. And she ran
down the mountain in haste, though the
stage, a grayish green one, was just turning
a curve at least a mile away.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" />Well, you <i>have</i> been parted a good while,&quot;
said Uncle James, as the two dear friends
met and embraced on the coach steps; &quot;a
day and a half!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd have 'most died if I'd waited any
longer,&quot; said Aunt Lucy, putting her arm
around her niece and leading her up the
gravel path with the pink &quot;old hen and
chickens&quot; on either side.</p>

<p>The little girls were entirely unlike, and
the contrast was pleasant to see. Lucy was
very fair, with light curling hair:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,<br /></span>
<span>Her cheeks like the dawn of day,<br /></span>
<span>And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds<br /></span>
<span>That ope in the month of May.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bab was quite as pretty, but in another
way. She had brilliant dark eyes and straight
dark hair with a satin gloss. She was half
a head shorter than her &quot;auntie,&quot; though their
<a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" />ages were about the same. People liked to
see them together, for they were always
sociable and happy, and loved each other
&quot;dearilee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Bab,&quot; said wee Lucy, &quot;I had such
a <i>loneness</i> without you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had a loneness too, Auntie Lucy.
Seemed as if the time never would go.&quot;</p>

<p>And then the dark head and the fair head
met again for more kisses, while both the
mammas looked on and said, in low tones
and with smiles, as they always did:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;How sweet! Now we shall hear them
singing about the place like two little birds.&quot;</p>

<p>This was Tuesday. The days went on
happily until Thursday afternoon, when &quot;the
Dunlee party,&quot; which always included the
Hales and Sanfords, set forth up the mountain
for a sight of the famous &quot;air-castle.&quot;
Of course Nate was with them, but this
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" />time not as a guide; the guide was Uncle
James.</p>

<p>The road, though rather steep, was not a
hard one. Mr. Dunlee had his alpenstock,
and Uncle James walked beside him, holding
little Eddo by the hand. Bab and Lucy, or
&quot;the little two,&quot; as Aunt Vi called them, were
side by side as usual, and Lucy had asked
Bab to repeat the story of &quot;Little Bo-Peep&quot;
in French, for Nate wanted to hear it. Bab
could speak French remarkably well.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Petit beau bouton<br /></span>
<span>A perde ses moutons,<br /></span>
<span>Il ne sais pas que les a pris.<br /></span>
<span>O laissez les tranquille!<br /></span>
<span>Ils se retournerons,<br /></span>
<span>Chacun sa queue apres lui.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee and Kyzie were just behind
the children, and while Bab was repeating
the verse Kyzie said in a low tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" />Oh, mamma, let me walk with you all the
way, please. There's something I want to
talk about.&quot;</p>

<p>She looked so earnest that Mrs. Dunlee
wondered not a little what it was her eldest
daughter had to say.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="V" id="V" /><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" />V</h3>

<h2>THE AIR-CASTLE</h2>


<p>&quot;A vacation school, Katharine? And pray
what may that be?&quot;</p>

<p>Kyzie's cheeks were flushed, her eyes shining.
She held her mother's hand and talked
fast, though plainly she did not feel quite at
her ease.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, mamma, you've certainly heard of
vacation schools&mdash;summer schools? They're
very common nowadays. In the summer, you
know; so that college people can go to them,
and business people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! Like the one at Coronado Beach?
Now I understand. But it didn't occur to me
that my little daughter would know enough to
teach college people!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" />Now, mamma, don't laugh at me! Of
course I mean children, the little ignorant
children right around here,&quot; making a sweeping
gesture toward the cottages and &quot;bunk
houses&quot; that dotted the country lower down
the mountain, &quot;I know enough to teach
little children, I should hope, mamma.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee's tone was so doubtful that her
daughter felt crushed.</p>

<p>&quot;Possibly you may know enough about
books; but book-knowledge is not all that
is required in a teacher. Could you keep
the children in order? Would they obey
you?&quot;</p>

<p>The little girl's head drooped a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see, you are only fourteen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fourteen last April, mamma. But everybody
says, don't you know, that I'm very large
for my age.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" />She tried to speak bravely, but the look of
quiet amusement on her listener's face made
it rather hard for her to go on.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose,&quot; said she, dropping her eyes
again, &quot;I suppose they don't know much
here, mamma,&mdash;the families that live here all
the time. Some of the boys actually go barefooted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I have observed. A great saving of
shoes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And they had a school last summer,&quot;
went on Kyzie, resolutely. &quot;A young girl
taught it who boarded where we do. Mr.
Templeton said she did it for fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they didn't like her a bit. I could
teach as well as she did anyway, mamma, for
she just went around the room boxing their
ears.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible, Katharine?&quot; Mrs. Dunlee
<a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" />was serious enough now. &quot;To box a child's
ears is simply brutal!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I knew you'd say so, mamma; but that
was just what Miss Severance did. Of course
I wouldn't touch their ears any more than I
would fly!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee turned now and regarded her
daughter attentively.</p>

<p>&quot;But how did you ever happen to take up
this sudden fancy for teaching, dear? It's all
new to me. What first made you think of it&mdash;at
your age? Can you tell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, mamma, I've been thinking about it,
off and on, for a year. Ever since I was at
Willowbrook last summer and heard Grandma
Parlin talk about <i>her</i> first school. Why, don't
you remember, she was just fourteen, she said,
nearly three months younger than I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee understood it all now, and
said to herself:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" />Dear old Grandma Parlin! Little did she
imagine she was filling her great grand-daughter's
head with mischievous notions!&quot;</p>

<p>They walked on a short way in silence.
&quot;But you must remember, Katharine, that was
seventy years ago. Grandma Parlin wouldn't
advise a girl of fourteen to do in these days as
she did then. Schools are very different now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, mamma, very, very different.
Isn't it too bad? I'd like to 'board 'round' the
way grandma did, and rap on the window
with a ferule, and 'choose sides' and all that!
But there's one thing I could do!&quot; exclaimed
the little girl, brightening. &quot;I could make
the children 'toe the mark'; wouldn't that be
fun? I mean stand in a line on a crack in the
floor. How grandma would laugh! I'll write
her all about it, and send her a photograph,
bare feet and all.&quot;</p>

<p>In her eagerness Kyzie spoke as if the
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" />matter were all arranged and she could almost
see the children &quot;toeing the mark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not so fast, my daughter. Remember
there are three points to be settled before we
can discuss the matter seriously. First, would
your papa consent? Second, would your
mamma consent? Third, do the people of
Castle Cliff want a summer school anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three points? I see, oh, yes,&quot; said Kyzie,
meekly.</p>

<p>&quot;But now, Katharine, let us walk a little
faster and join the others. And not a word
more of this to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did keep you two so long?&quot; asked
Edith, coming to meet them with a bright
face. If her happy thoughts had not been
dwelling on the zebra cat just presented her
by the &quot;knitting-woman,&quot; she would have
observed at once that mamma and Kyzie had
been &quot;talking secrets&quot;; though she might not
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" />have suspected that this had anything to do
with the vacation school.</p>

<p>&quot;Do hurry along,&quot; she added. I want to
show you the funniest sight! I don't believe
you've seen Barbara Hale, have you?&quot;</p>

<p>Edith could hardly speak for laughing;
and her mother and Kyzie did not wonder
when they beheld the figure that little Bab
had made of herself, by a new style of
dressing her hair. The two little girls were,
as I have told you, as different as possible,
but had an intense desire to look &quot;just alike&quot;;
and when they tried their best the result was
very funny.</p>

<p>I will mention here that Lucy &quot;despised&quot;
her own hair for not being straight like Bab's,
and had often tried to braid it down her
back; but as the braid always came out and
the ribbon came off, the attempt had been
forbidden.</p>

<p><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" />Now, however, as the children had left
their city home and come to a place where
everybody was &quot;on holiday,&quot; the mammas
decided that they might have a little more
liberty.</p>

<p>Their dresses were off the same piece,&mdash;good,
strong brown ones; their hats were
alike; and, as for their hair, they were
allowed to wear it as they pleased &quot;just for
this summer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll look exactly alike up there in the
mountains,&quot; the little souls had said to each
other; and this was perhaps one reason why
they had been so overjoyed at the prospect
of going.</p>

<div class="center">
<a name='illus-078' id='illus-078'></a>
<img src="images/illus-078.jpg"
alt="&quot;'It is perfectly awful!' said Aunt Lucy&quot;"
title="&quot;'It is perfectly awful!' said Aunt Lucy&quot;" />
<h4><b>"'It is perfectly awful!' said Aunt Lucy"</b></h4>
</div>

<p>But to-day, ah! who would have dreamed
that sweet little Bab could become such a
fright? She had done up her hair the night
before on as many as twenty curl-papers.
Before starting for the air-castle she had
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" />taken out some of the papers and found&mdash;not
ringlets, but wisps of very unruly hair.
It would not curl any more than water will
run up hill.</p>

<p>She went to Aunt Lucy in her trouble to
seek advice. Aunt Lucy looked her over
with great care and then announced:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;It is perfectly awful! Don't take out
any more papers, Bab. Let 'em be, so you
can have something to stick the curls on
to.&quot;</p>

<p>And so it was done. The &quot;curls,&quot; as Lucy
was pleased to call them, were drawn up and
looped and twisted and fastened by hair-pins
to the other curls left in the papers. The effect
was most surprising. It made Bab's head so
much higher than usual that she was as tall
now as auntie, and that in itself was a great
gain. Besides, this style, as Lucy said, was
the &quot;pompy-doo,&quot; and very fashionable!</p>

<p><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" />If Bab could have kept her hat on! But
she couldn't, and the moment it came off
they all cried out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Why-ee, Barbara!&quot; and turned away to
laugh.</p>

<p>If Mrs. McQuilken had been there she
would have said the child looked &quot;as if she
was possessed of the fox.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The little goosies! Let them enjoy it!&quot;
whispered Mrs. Hale to Mrs. Dunlee. &quot; But
those topknots will have to come down before
the child can go to the dinner-table.&quot;</p>

<p>And then both the ladies laughed privately
behind a large tree. The mountain air was
doing them good, and they often had as
merry times together as the young people.</p>

<p>&quot;Hear the boyoes,&quot; cried Edith, meaning
Jimmy and Nate, who had now reached the
air-castle and were shouting with all their
might. The children ran, and so indeed did
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" />the older ones, for there was an excellent
path all the way.</p>

<p>&quot;So that is the air-castle,&quot; exclaimed
Kyzie, when they were all within sight of it.
&quot;It's a real house, built right in the mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>She was right. There happened to be a
great crack right here in the rocky side of
the mountain, and a cunning little house had
been tucked into the crack. It was built of
small stones. It had two real windows with
glass panes, and a real door with a brass
knocker, which the children declared was &quot;too
cute for anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The house is as strong as a fort,&quot; said
Uncle James. &quot;Do you observe it is walled
all around with stones?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know who built it?&quot; asked Aunt
Vi; &quot;and why he built it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A rich Mexican named Bandini. He ad<a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" />mired
the view from the mountain, and I
don't blame him, do you? He wanted a nice,
quiet place where he could read and write;
that was why he came here. He has been
here every summer for years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Dunlee, &quot;if you call this
an air-castle I must say it is the most solid
one I ever heard of! It doesn't look dreamy
at all. Why, an earthquake could hardly
shake it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The steps that lead up to it are not
dreamy either,&quot; said Mrs. Dunlee. &quot;Real
granite; and there's a large flag up there
floating from the evergreen tree.&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;boyoes&quot; had already climbed the
steps, and Nate called down to Mrs. Dunlee,
&quot;It's the Mexican flag!&quot; But she had known
that at a glance. The colors were red, white,
and green, and the device was an eagle on a
prickly pear with a snake in his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" />I wonder if there's anybody at home,&quot;
said Nate, and would have lifted the knocker
if Jimmy had not said, &quot;Wait for Uncle
James.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy thought as Uncle James was the
leader of the expedition he should be the one
to do the knocking, or at any rate to tell
them when to knock. Nate himself had not
thought of this. He was not so refined as
Jimmy, either by nature or by training.</p>

<p>Everybody had climbed the steps now.
The older people were enjoying the magnificent
view; but Bab and Lucy were looking
for the two toads who had been seen going
up to the castle together, the well toad taking
the lame toad's foot in his mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish they were both here,&quot; said Uncle
James, &quot;for you would like to see them take
that little journey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the Mexican who built this air-<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" />castle,&quot;
said Aunt Vi, &quot;is he here this summer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, he died last spring.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Died?&quot; echoed little Eddo, who had heard
that dying means &quot;going up in the sky.&quot;
&quot;What made him die, mamma? Didn't he
like it down here?&quot;</p>

<p>Then without waiting for a reply he added
most tenderly and unexpectedly, &quot;Isn't it nice
that <i>you're</i> not dead, mamma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you think that, my son?&quot; she
asked, wondering what he would say.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, <i>be</i>-cause I <i>am</i> so glad about it.&quot; And
at this sweet little speech his mother caught
him up in her arms and kissed him. How
could she help it?</p>

<p>&quot;Now,&quot; said Uncle James, &quot;let us see if
we can enter the castle. 'Open locks whoever
knocks.' Try it, boys.&quot;</p>

<p>Nate lifted the knocker and pounded with
<a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" />a will. There was no answer or sign of
life.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's see if this will help us,&quot; said Uncle
James, taking a key from his vest pocket:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;For I'm the keeper of the keys,<br /></span>
<span>And I do whatever I please.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The key actually fitted the lock, the door
opened at once, and they all entered the
castle.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Templeton lent me the key,&quot; explained
Mr. Sanford. &quot;He said the castle
was as empty as a last year's bird's nest, but
I thought we might like to take a look at
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We do, oh, we do,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;Isn't it
queer? Just two rooms and nothing in 'em
at all! Oh, Bab, let's you and I bring some
dishes up here and keep house! Here's a
cupboard right in the wall.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" />I guess it's Mother Hubbard's cupboard,
it looks bare enough. Just a table in the room
and one old chair,&quot; exclaimed Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad we came in, though,&quot; said Kyzie.
&quot;Isn't it beautiful to stand in the door and
look down, down, and see Castle Cliff right
at your feet? And off there a city&mdash;Why,
what's that noise?&quot;</p>

<p>No one answered. The older people knew
the sound: it was that of an angry rattlesnake
out of doors shaking his rattle.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Stay in the house, please, you ladies, and
keep the children here. James and I will go
out and attend to this.&quot;</p>

<p>He had an alpenstock, Uncle James a cane.
The ladies and Mr, Hale and the children
watched the two gentlemen from the window,&mdash;all
but little Eddo, whose mother was playing
bo-peep with him to prevent him from
<a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" />looking out. A handsome rattlesnake was
winding his way up the mountain in pursuit
of a tiny baby rabbit. The little &quot;cotton-tail&quot;
was running for the castle as fast as he
could, intending to hide in a hole under the
door-stone. But he never would have reached
the door-stone alive, poor little trembling creature,
if Mr. Dunlee and Uncle James had not
come up just in time to finish the cruel snake
with cane and alpenstock. Bunny got away
safe, without even stopping to say, &quot;Thank
you.&quot; The snake wore seven rattles, of which
he was very proud; but Eddo had them next
day for a plaything, and made as much noise
with them as ever the snake had done;
though Eddo never knew where they came
from.</p>

<p>It had been a delightful day, and when the
friends all met again at table they kept saying,
&quot;Didn't we have a good time?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" />It was to be noticed that Barbara's &quot;topknots&quot;
had disappeared; and I am glad to
say that she never wore her lovely hair
&quot;pompy-doo&quot; again.</p>

<p>Kyzie's face was alight. In passing the
door of her mother's room she had heard her
father say, laughing:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;What, our Katharine? Why, how that
would amuse Mr. Templeton!&quot;</p>

<p>Kyzie had hurried away for fear of listening;
but now she kept thinking:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Papa laughed. He always laughs when he
is going to say 'yes.' He'll talk to Mr.
Templeton, and I just know I shall have the
school Isn't it splendid?&quot;</p>

<h2>&quot;GRANDMA GRAYMOUSE&quot;</h2>


<p>&quot;Hoopty-Doo!&quot; shouted Jimmy, alighting
on the piazza on all fours. &quot;A little girl like
that keep school!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she is going to,&quot; returned Edith,
looking up from the picture she was drawing
of a cherub in the clouds, &quot;she's going to;
and Mr. Templeton says the Castle Cliff people
are as pleased as they can be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I heard what he said,&quot; struck in Nate.
&quot;He said they jumped at it like a dolphin at
a silver spoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's always talking about that dolphin
and that silver spoon,&quot; laughed Edith. &quot;If I
knew how a dolphin looks, I'd draw one and
give it to him just for fun. But mamma, you
<a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" />don't expect me to go to school to that little
girl; now do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly not, Edith; oh, no.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Must <i>I</i> go to Grandmother Graymouse?&quot;
whined Jimmy, &quot;She's only my sister. And
I came up here to play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Play all you like, my son. No one will
ask you to go school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But <i>I</i> really want to go,&quot; said Nate. &quot;I
wouldn't miss it for anything. A girl's school
like that will be larks. Only four hours anyway,
two in the forenoon and two in the
afternoon. Time enough left for play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm, if that's all, let's go,&quot; cried Jimmy.
&quot;We can leave off any time we get tired of
it.&quot;</p>

<p>Kyzie heard this as she was crossing the
hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, boys,&quot; she said, &quot;you don't live in
Castle Cliff! It's the Castle Cliff children<a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" />
I'm going to teach&mdash;the little ones, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But papa said if you'd show me about
my arithmetic&mdash;&quot; began Nate.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps I don't know so much as you do,
Nate. But if you go you'll be good, won't
you&mdash;you and Jimmy both?&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke with some concern. &quot;For if
you're naughty, the other boys will think they
can be naughty too; and I shan't know what
in the world to do with them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we'll sit up as straight as ninepins;
we'll show 'em how city boys behave,&quot; said
Nate, making a bow to Kyzie.</p>

<p>He could be a perfect little gentleman when
he chose. He liked to tease Jimmy, younger
than himself, but had always been polite to
Kyzie. Still Kyzie did not altogether like the
thought of having a boy of twelve for a pupil.
What if he should laugh at her behind his slate?</p>

<p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" />Here Barbara and Lucy appeared upon the
veranda, holding Edith's new kitty between
them.</p>

<p>&quot;We're going. We'll sit together and cut
out paper dolls and eat figs under the seat,&quot;
declared Lucy, never doubting that this would
be pleasing news to the young teacher.</p>

<p>Before Kyzie had time to say, &quot;Why,
Lucy!&quot; little Eddo ran up the steps to ask in
haste:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Lucy going? I fink I'll go
too.&quot;</p>

<p>Kyzie could bear no more. She ran and
hid in the hammock and cried. They all
thought she was to have a sort of play-school;
did they? They were going just for
fun. She must talk to mamma. Mamma
thought the school was foolish business; but
mamma always knew what ought to be done,
and how to help do it. Or if mamma ever
<a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" />felt puzzled, there was papa to go to,&mdash;papa,
who could not possibly make a mistake.
Between them they would see that their eldest
daughter was treated fairly.</p>

<p>Monday morning came. Kyzie's courage had
revived. Eddo would be kept at home; Lucy
and Bab had been informed that they were
not to cut paper dolls, though they might
write on their slates. All that they thought of
just now, the dear &quot;little two,&quot; was of dressing
to &quot;look exactly alike.&quot; As Bab had
learned once for all that her hair would not
curl, she spent half an hour that morning
braiding her auntie's ringlets down her back,
and tying the cue with a pink ribbon like her
own. But for all the little barber could do
the flaxen cue would not lie flat. It was an
old story, but very provoking.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear,&quot; wailed Lucy, &quot;'most school-time
and my hair is all <i>over</i> my head!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" />It did look wild. You could almost fancy
it was angry because it had not been allowed
to curl after its own graceful fashion.</p>

<p>The &quot;little two&quot; started off in good season,
hoping not to be seen by Eddo; but he
espied them from the window, and they heard
him calling till his baby voice was lost in the
distance:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You ought to not leave me! You ought
to not leave m-e-e!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He wants to go everywhere big people
go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; responded Bab. &quot;Such babies think
they are as old as anybody. Oh, see that
Mexican dog, how straight his tail stands up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like your hair,&quot; sighed Lucy. &quot;If my
hair would only be straight like that!&quot;</p>

<p>And neither of them smiled at this droll
remark.</p>

<p>&quot;But there's one thing we must remember,<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" />
Bab. I'm glad I thought of it. We must say,
'Miss' to Kyzie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Dunlee. If we forget it, she'll feel
dreadfully.&quot; And then they began to hum
a tune and keep step to the music. They
often did this as they walked.</p>

<p>Kyzie had gone on before them. Her
father was with her, but she had the key in
her hand and opened the schoolhouse door.
They walked in together, and Kyzie locked
the door behind them, for several children
were waiting about who must not enter till
the bell rang.</p>

<p>The schoolhouse floor was very clean; the
new teacher herself had swept it. On the
walls were large wreaths of holly, which had
been left over from last Christmas, when the
Sunday-school had had a celebration here. At
one end of the room was a raised platform
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" />with a large desk on it. On the wall over
the desk was a motto made of red pepper
berries, only the words were so close together
that you could not make them out unless you
knew beforehand what they were.</p>

<p>&quot;That means, 'Christ is risen,'&quot; explained
Kyzie. &quot;It looks dreadfully, but they didn't
want it taken down, I'll make another by
and by.&quot;</p>

<p>There were blackboards on three sides of
the room; quite clean they looked now. The
desks and benches were rude ones of black
oak, and had been hacked by jack-knives.
Kyzie regretted this, but supposed the boys
had not been taught any better. There was
only one chair in the room, a large armed
chair for the little teacher, and it stood
solemnly on the platform before the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, papa, I've brought a big blank-book
to write the names in. The pen and
<a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" />inkstand belong here. Ahem, I begin to
tremble,&quot; said she, and looked at her
mother's watch which she wore in her belt.
&quot;It's five minutes of nine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you'll do famously,&quot; said Mr. Dunlee.
&quot;And now, daughter, I'll wish you good-by
and the very best luck in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-by, papa,&quot; said Kyzie, and locked
the door after him. &quot;I wish I'd asked him
to stay till I called them in and took their
names. Papa is so dignified that it would
have been a great help. My, I feel as if I
weren't more than six years old!&quot;</p>

<p>She walked the floor, watch in hand.
&quot;Fifty seconds of nine.&quot;</p>

<p>She went to the bell-rope and pulled with
both hands. It was quite needless to use so
much force. The bell was directly over her
head; and instead of the &quot;mellow lin-lan-lone&quot;
she expected, it made a din so tre<a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" />mendous
that it almost seemed as if the roof
were about to fall upon her. At the same
time there was a scrambling and pounding at
the door. The children were trying to get in.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, miserable me, I've locked them out!&quot;
thought the little teacher in dismay.</p>

<p>She hastened to the door and opened it,
and they rushed in with a shout. This was
an odd beginning; but Kyzie said not a word.
She remembered that she was now Miss Dunlee,
so she threw back her shoulders and
looked her straightest and tallest, and as
much as possible like Miss Prince, her favorite
teacher. She had intended all along to
imitate Miss Prince&mdash;whenever she could
think of it.</p>

<p>Only fourteen years old! Well, what of
that? Grandma Parlin had been only fourteen
when she taught <i>her</i> first school. Keep a
brave heart, Katharine Dunlee!</p>

<p><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" />Joe Rolfe walked in as stiffly as a wooden
soldier. Behind him came a few boys and
girls, some of them with their fingers in
their mouths. There were twelve in all.
The last ones to enter were Nate and Jimmy,
followed by Aunt Lucy and her niece arm in
arm.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if Nate is laughing at me for
locking the door?&quot; thought Kyzie, not daring
to look at him, as she waved her hands and
said in a loud voice to be heard above the
noise:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;All please be seated.&quot;</p>

<p>Being seated was a work of time; and
what a din it made! The children wandered
about, trying one bench after another to see
which they liked best.</p>

<p>&quot;You would think they were getting settled
for life,&quot; whispered Nate to Jimmy.</p>

<p>The &quot;little two&quot; chose a place near the
<a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" />west window and began at once to write on
their slates.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm scared of Miss Dunlee,&quot; wrote Aunt
Lucy.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop making me laugh,&quot; replied the niece.</p>

<p>When at last everybody was &quot;settled for
life,&quot; Kyzie did not know what to do next.
&quot;What would Miss Prince do? Why she
would read in the Bible. I forgot that.&quot;</p>

<p>The new teacher took her stand on the
platform behind the desk, opened her Bible,
and read aloud the twenty-third Psalm. Her
voice shook, partly from fright, partly from
trying so hard not to laugh. But she did not
even smile&mdash;far from it. Nate and Jimmy
who were watching her could have told you
that. If she had been at a funeral she could
hardly have looked more solemn.</p>

<p>Jimmy touched Nate's foot under the bench;
Nate gave Jimmy a shove; Bab gazed hard
<a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" />at Lucy's flaxen cue; Lucy gazed straight at
her thumb.</p>

<p>After the reading &quot;Miss Dunlee&quot; walked
about with her blank-book in one hand and her
pen in the other to take down the children's
names.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Joseph Rolfe; don't you remember
me?&quot; said the boy with red hair. &quot;And
this boy next seat is Chicken Little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I ain't either, I'm Henry Small,&quot;
corrected the little fellow, ready to cry.</p>

<p>Kyzie shook her finger at both the boys
and resolved that &quot;Joe should stop calling
names, and Henry should stop being such a
cry-baby.&quot;</p>

<p>Annie Farrell was a dear little girl in a blue
and white gingham gown, and the new teacher
loved her at once. Dorothy Pratt was little
more than a baby, and when spoken to she put
her apron to her eyes and wanted to go home.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" />She can't go home,&quot; said her older sister
Janey, &quot;mamma's cookin' for company!&quot;</p>

<p>Kyzie patted the baby's tangled hair and
sent Janey to get her some water.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go,&quot; spoke up Jack Whiting, aged
seven. &quot;Janey isn't big enough. Besides
the pail leaks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad Edith isn't here,&quot; thought
Kyzie, &quot;or we should both get to giggling.
There, it's time now to call them out to read.
Let me see, where is the best crack in the
floor for them to stand on? Why didn't I
bring a quarter of a dollar with a hole in it
for a medal? Oh, the medal will be for the
spelling-class; that was what Grandma Parlin
said.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed a &quot;ling-long&quot; forenoon, and the
little teacher rejoiced when eleven o'clock
came. The family at home looked at her
curiously, and Uncle James asked outright,<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" />
&quot;Tell us, Grandmother Graymouse, how do
the scholars behave?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose they behaved as well as
they knew how; but oh, it makes me so
hungry!&quot;</p>

<p>She could not say whether she liked teaching
or not.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait till Friday night, Uncle James, and
then I'll tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well said, Grandmother Graymouse! You
couldn't have made a wiser remark. We'll
ask no further questions till Friday night.&quot;</p>

<p>But when Friday night came they were all
thinking of something else, something quite
out of the common; and &quot;Grandmother Graymouse&quot;
and her school were forgotten.</p>

<h2>THE ZEBRA KITTEN</h2>


<p>It began with Zee. By this time her young
mistress had become very much attached to
her; and so indeed had all the &quot;Dunlee
party.&quot; Even Mrs. Dunlee petted the kitten
and said she was the most graceful creature
she had ever seen, except, perhaps, the dancing
horse, Thistleblow. Eddo loved her because
&quot;she hadn't any pins in her feet&quot; and
did not resent his rough handling. The &quot;little
two&quot; loved her because she allowed them to
play all sorts of games with her. They could
make believe she was very ill and tuck her
up in bed, and she would swallow meekly
such medicine as alum with salt and water
without even a mew.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" />She is so amiable,&quot; said Edith. &quot;And
then that wonderful tail of hers, mamma!
'Twould bring, I don't know how much
money, at a cat fair. It's a regular <i>prize</i>
tail, you see!&quot;</p>

<p>An animal like this merited extra care.
She was not to be put off like an everyday
cat with saucers of milk and scraps of meat;
she must have the choicest bits from the
table.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. McQuilken says the best-fed cats
make the best mousers,&quot; said Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so, Miss Edith? Then the mice
here at Castle Cliff haven't long to live!&quot;
laughed good-natured Mr. Templeton, as he
handed Zee's little mistress a pitcher of excellent
cream.</p>

<p>Edith was very grateful to Mrs. McQuilken
for this remarkable kitten. She had taken
much pains with her pencil drawing of a
<a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" />cherub in the clouds, intending it as a present
for the eccentric old lady.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you suppose she'll like it, mamma?
You know she's so odd that one never can
tell.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee was sure the picture would be
appreciated. The cherub's sweet face looked
like Eddo's, and the clouds lay about him
very softly, leaving bare his pretty dimpled
feet, and hands, and arms, and neck. On
Friday afternoon Edith took the picture in her
hand and knocked with a beating heart at the
door of Number Five.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Me&mdash;McQuilken,&quot; said she, in a
timid voice, on entering the room, &quot;you're so
fond of pictures that I thought I'd bring you
one I drew myself. I'm afraid it's not so
very, very good; but I hope you'll like it
just a little.&quot;</p>

<div class="center">

<h4><b>Edith painting the Cherub for Mrs. McQuilken</b></h4>
</div>

<p>Mrs. McQuilken was much surprised as well
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" />as gratified; and actually there were tears in
her eyes as she took the offering from Edith's
hand. She was a lonely old body, and never
expected much attention from any one, especially
from children.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, how kind of you, my dear! It's a
beauty!&quot; she exclaimed, gazing at the cherub
through her spectacles. She was a good
judge of pictures. &quot;That face is well drawn,
and the clouds are fleecy. Did you really do
it your own self&mdash;and for me? Thank you,
dear child!&quot;</p>

<p>Edith blushed with pleasure. She had by
no means counted on such praise.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll always be kind to old people after
this,&quot; she thought. &quot;I believe they care more
about it than you think they do.&quot;</p>

<p>But here they were interrupted by the very
loud mewing of a cat out of doors. They
both ran downstairs to see what it meant.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" />I do hope and trust it isn't my Zee,&quot; cried
Edith in alarm.</p>

<p>But it was. They did not see her at
first; she was in the back yard behind the
hotel. It seems a pan of clams had been
left standing on the back door-step; and
Zee must have been frolicking about the
pan, never dreaming any live creature was
in it, when one of the clams, attracted by
her black waving tail, had caught the tip
of the tail in his mouth and was holding it
fast!</p>

<p>This was pretty severe. Being only an
ignorant bivalve, the clam did not know that
what he had in his mouth was a very precious
article, the &quot;prize tail&quot; of a beautiful cat.
But having once taken hold of it, the clam
was too obstinate to let go.</p>

<p>Poor Zee jumped up and down, and ran
around in circles, mewing with all her might.<a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" />
What had happened she did not know; she
only knew some heavy thing was dragging at
her tail and pinching it fearfully. Every one
in the back of the house was busy; no one
but Eddo heard Zee's cries. He ran to the
maid to ask &quot;what made the kitty sing so
sorry?&quot; Whenever she mewed he called it
singing.</p>

<p>The maid looked out then and threw down
her mixing-spoon for laughing. It was an
odd sight to see a cat prancing about, waving
her plume-like tail with a clam at the end of
it! Nancy was sorry for the kitten, but did
not know how in the world to get off the
clam.</p>

<p>&quot;Take an axe! Take a hatchet!&quot; cried
Mrs. McQuilken.</p>

<p>And without waiting for Nancy she seized
a hatchet herself, split the shell of the clam,
and let poor kitty free.</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" />When Kyzie got home from school, Mrs.
McQuilken had just mended Zee's bleeding
member with a piece of court-plaster. All
the boarders were grouped about on the lawn
and veranda talking it over. Mrs. Dunlee
held in her lap a very forlorn and crumpled
little bundle of kitty; and Edith and Eddo
were crying as if their hearts would break.</p>

<p>&quot;That beautiful, beautiful tail!&quot; sobbed
Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be unhappy about it, darling,&quot; said
Aunt Vi, &quot;it will heal in time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know 't will heal, auntie; but what I'm
thinking of is, won't it be stiff? Aren't you
afraid 'twill lose the&mdash;the&mdash;<i>expression of the
wiggle?</i>&quot;</p>

<p>No one even smiled at the question; everybody
tried to comfort Edith. And right in
the midst of this trying scene another event
occurred of a different sort, but far more se<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" />rious.
It was little wonder that nobody once
thought of saying to Kyzie:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Grandma Graymouse, you promised
to tell us to-night how you like your school.&quot;</p>

<p>The school was quite forgotten, and so was
the injured kitten. It happened in this way:
As soon as the kitten had been placed in a
basket of cotton and seemed tolerably comfortable,
Jimmy and &quot;the little two&quot; went
along the road as they often did to watch for
the stage. &quot;The colonel&quot; might be coming now
at almost any time, to find the lost vein of the
gold mine, and they wanted to see him first of
any one. Lucy had her papa's watch fastened
to the waist of her dress, and took great pleasure
in seeing the hands move. This was not
the first time she had been allowed to carry the
watch, and she was very proud because papa
had just said, &quot;See how I trust my little girl.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy had Uncle James's spy-glass.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" />Nate thinks the colonel won't come till
to-morrow; but I expect him to-night. Let's
go farther up,&quot; said Jimmy-boy.</p>

<p>They all climbed a little way and stood on
a rock gazing down toward the dusty road.
They could see the roofs of several houses,
and Lucy asked why there was so much wire
on them.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's to hold the chimneys on,&quot; was
Jimmy's reply.</p>

<p>&quot;How queer!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not queer at all. I've seen lots of chimneys
tied on that way.&quot;</p>

<p>Bab doubted this, but Lucy was proud to
think how much Jimmy knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Six minutes past five,&quot; said she, looking at
the watch again. &quot;It takes these little hands
just as long to go round this little face as it
takes a clock's hands to go round a clock's
face. How funny!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" />Not funny at all,&quot; said Jimmy. &quot;They're
made that way. But be careful, Lucy Dunlee,
or you'll drop that watch. I shouldn't have
thought papa would have let you bring it up
here. Did you tell him where we were going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I never,&quot; replied Lucy with a sudden
prick of conscience. &quot;I didn't know we'd
go so far. 'Twas you that spoke and said
we'd go higher up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you'd better let me take it, Lucy.
I'm older than you are, and I've got a little
pocket, too, just the right size to hold it.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy hesitated, not wishing to part with
the watch, and not at all sure that it would
be safer with Jimmy than with herself. He
was not a famous care-taker.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see why you want to get it away
when papa lent it to me and it's fastened on
so tight. How do I know papa would be
willing?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" />As she spoke, however, Jimmy was fingering
the little chain to see if he could undo
the clasp which held it to her dress.</p>

<p>&quot;There, I don't believe you could have got
it off, Lucy, you didn't know how.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I never tried&mdash;papa fastened it on
himself&mdash;oh, Jimmy-boy, you will be so
careful of it, now won't you?&quot;</p>

<p>For the watch lay in his hand, and she did
not know how to get it back again. When he
had set his heart on anything Lucy usually
gave up. Barbara looked on in disapproval
as the big brother put the watch in his
pocket.</p>

<p>It had long been Jimmy's unspoken wish
to have a watch of his very own like Nate
Pollard and various other boys. How rich
and handsome the short gold chain looked!
What a bright spot it made as it dangled
down his new jacket. He gazed at it admir<a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" />ingly,
while Bab and Lucy took turns in looking
through the spy-glass.</p>

<p>&quot;The stage is coming,&quot; they cried. Then
they all started and ran down the mountain;
but as the stage drove up to the hotel no
colonel alighted, or at least, no one who
looked like a colonel. Jimmy was playing
with the short gold chain which made a bright
spot on his jacket. He meant to restore the
watch to its owner at dinner-time; but it was
early, he was not going in yet. And there
was Nate Pollard throwing up his cap and
looking ready for a frolic.</p>

<p>&quot;I stump you to catch me!&quot; said Nate.</p>

<p>&quot;Poh, I can catch you and not half try.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy-boy was agile, Nate rather heavily
built and clumsy. But if Jimmy had suspected
what a foolhardy project was in Nate's
mind he would have held back from the
race.</p>

<p><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" />As it was, they both planted themselves
against a tree, shouted, &quot;One, two, three!&quot;
and off they started. No one was watching,
no one remembered afterward which way
they were going.</p>

<h2>STEALING A CHIMNEY</h2>


<p>The &quot;knitting-woman&quot; sat knitting in her
chamber that looked up the mountain side, and
thinking how the zebra kitten had suffered
from her enemy, the clam. Mrs. McQuilken's
own cats were most of them asleep; the blind
canary was eating her supper of hemp-seed;
and the noisy magpie had run off to chat
with the dog and hens. The room seemed
remarkably quiet. Mrs. McQuilken narrowed
two stitches and glanced out of the window.</p>

<p>&quot;Mercy upon us!&quot; she exclaimed, though
there was not a soul to hear her. &quot;Mercy
upon us, what are those boyoes doing atop of
that house?&quot;</p>

<p>In her astonishment she actually dropped
<a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" />her knitting-work on the floor and rushed out
of the room crying, &quot;Fire!&quot; though there was
not a spark of fire to be seen.</p>

<p>The &quot;boyoes&quot; were Nate and Jimmy.
Nate had said to Jimmy just as they started
on the race:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;You won't dare follow where I lead;&quot;
and Jimmy, stung by the defiant tone, had
answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Poh, yes, I will! Who's afraid?&quot; never
once suspecting that Nate was going to climb
the ridge-pole of a house!</p>

<p>The house was a small cabin painted green,
but there were people living in it, and nothing
could be ruder than to storm it in this
way, as both boys knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Nate why, <i>Nate</i>, what are you
doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ho, needn't come if you're scared,&quot; retorted
Nate.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" />Who said I was scared? But I'm not
your 'caddy,' I won't go another step,&quot;
gasped Jimmy.</p>

<p>Still he did not stop climbing. Hadn't
Nate &quot;stumped&quot; him; and hadn't he &quot;taken
the stump,&quot; agreeing to follow his lead?
Besides, Nate was already on the roof, and it
was necessary to catch him at once.</p>

<p>Jimmy reached the roof easily enough and
darted toward Nate with both arms out-stretched.
But by that time Nate had turned
around and begun to slide down another
ridge-pole, shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Here, my caddy, here I am; catch me,
caddy!&quot;</p>

<p>It was most exasperating. Jimmy saw that
he had been outwitted. On the solid earth,
running a fair race, the chances were that he
could have beaten Nate. But was this a fair
race?</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" />No, I'll leave it out to anybody if it's fair!
Nate Pollard is the meanest boy in California,&quot;
thought angry Jimmy, as he started to follow
his leader down the ridge-pole.</p>

<p>At this moment something hit him just
below the knee and held him fast. In his
haste he had not stopped to notice that the
chimney was of the very sort he had just
described to Lucy&mdash;built of tiles and held on
to the roof by wires. He was caught in
these wires; and whenever he tried to move
he found he was actually pulling the chimney
after him! Nate, safely landed on the ground,
called back to him in triumph:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Jimmy-cum-jim! Hello, my caddy!
Where are you? Why don't you come
along?&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy was coming as fast as he could.
He lay face downward, sliding along toward
the edge of the roof, and carrying with him
<a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" />that most undesirable chimney! What would
become of him if he should fall head-first
with the chimney on his back?</p>

<p>It was a rough scramble; but he managed
to turn over before he reached the ground&mdash;so
that he landed on his feet. The chimney
landed near him, a wreck. Jimmy was unhurt
except for a few scratches. But oh, it
was dreadful to hear himself laughed at, not
only by that mischievous Nate, but by
half a dozen other boys and a few grown
people, who had collected on the spot; among
them the landlord and Mrs. McQuilken.</p>

<p>Not that any one could be blamed for
laughing. Jimmy was a comical object. In
carrying away a chimney which did not
belong to him, he had of course torn his
clothes frightfully and left big pieces sticking
on the broken wires of the roof. A more
&quot;raggety&quot; boy never was seen.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_114" id="Page_114" />Wouldn't he make a good scarecrow?&quot;
said the landlord, shaking his sides. &quot;Jimmum,
chimney, and all!&quot;</p>

<p>It was necessary to tear his clothes still
more in order to get them free from the
tangle of wires. As the poor young culprit
crept unwillingly back to the hotel all the
cats, dogs, donkeys, and chickens in Castle
Cliff seemed to combine in a chorus of mewing,
barking, braying, and cackling to inform
the whole world that here was a boy who had
stolen a chimney!</p>

<p>What wretched little beggar was this coming
to the house? No one thought of its being
Jimmy Dunlee.</p>

<p>&quot;We caught this young rogue stealing a
chimney,&quot; said Mr. Templeton.</p>

<p>It seemed funny at first, and the Dunlees
and Sanfords and Hales all laughed heartily,
till it occurred to them that the dear child
<a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" />had been in actual danger; and then they
drew long breaths and shuddered, thinking
how he might have pitched headlong to the
ground and been crushed by the weight of
the chimney.</p>

<p>&quot;But my little son,&quot; asked Mrs. Dunlee
presently, when the child was once more
respectably clad, and was walking down to
dinner between herself and Aunt Vi, &quot;but
my little son, what could have possessed you
to climb a roof? Was that a nice thing to
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mamma, of course not. But 'twas all
Nate Pollard's fault. Nate stumped me to it
and I took the stump.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What <i>do</i> you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, he said, 'You won't dare follow me,'
and I said, 'Yes, I would.' And I never mistrusted
where he was going. Who'd have
thought of his climbing top of a house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" />Why, Jamie Dunlee, you did not follow
Nate without knowing where he was going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, mamma; if I <i>had</i> known I wouldn't
have followed. But you see he had stumped
me and I'd taken the stump, so I was <i>obliged</i>
to go!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Obliged to go!&quot; repeated Aunt Vi, laughing,
&quot;Isn't that characteristic of Jimmy?&quot;</p>

<p>The little fellow felt guiltier than ever.
When Aunt Vi used that word of five syllables
it always meant that people had done very
wrong, so he thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Jamie,&quot; said his mother very seriously, &quot;I
am surprised that you should have promised
to follow Nate without knowing where he was
going! And you never even asked him where
he was going! Is that the way you play, you
boys?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mamma, it isn't. Nate makes you
play his way because he's the oldest. He's
<a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" />just as mean! But I couldn't back out after
I was stumped.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fie! Backing out is exactly the thing
to do when a boy is trying to lead you into
mischief! But we'll talk more of this by and
by.&quot;</p>

<p>As they entered the dining-room, Jimmy
squared his shoulders and would not look
toward Nate's table; and Nate, who had been
severely reproved by his parents, never once
raised his eyes from his plate. No one felt
very happy. Jimmy's new suit was ruined;
and Mr. Dunlee had already learned that
it would cost ten dollars to restore the tile
chimney. Nor was this all. While Jimmy was
trying to console himself with ice-cream he
suddenly thought of his father's watch! It
must have dropped out of his pocket when
he slid down the roof; but where, oh, where
was it now? Was it still on the ground, or
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" />had some one picked it up? Joe Rolfe had
been there, so had Chicken Little and a dozen
others. He must go and look for that watch,
he must go this minute.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; he murmured, pushing aside his
saucer of ice-cream, &quot;may I&mdash;may I be
excused?&quot;</p>

<p>There was no answer; his mother had not
heard him.</p>

<p>&quot;Mamma,&quot; in a louder tone, &quot;oh, mamma!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it, my son?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing by his unhappy face that something
was wrong, she nodded permission for him to
leave the table; and at the same time arose
and followed him into the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear child, what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Papa's watch,&quot; he moaned. &quot;I'm afraid
somebody will steal it.&quot;</p>

<p>As Mrs. Dunlee knew nothing whatever
about the watch this sounded very strange.<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" />
She wondered if Jimmy had really been hurt
by his fall and was out of his head.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, my precious little boy,&quot; said she, taking
his hot hand in hers. &quot;Papa's watch is safe
in his vest pocket. Nobody is going to steal it.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy looked immensely relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, has he got it back again? I'm so
glad! Where did he find it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Darling,&quot; said Mrs. Dunlee, now really
alarmed. &quot;Come upstairs with mamma. Does
your head ache? I think it will be best for
you to go right to bed.&quot;</p>

<p>But Jimmy persisted in talking about the
watch.</p>

<p>&quot;Where did papa find it? He let Lucy
have it; don't you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I did not know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I took it away from Lucy. I was
afraid she'd lose it. And then,&mdash;oh, dear,
oh, dear,&mdash;then I went and lost it myself!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" />Mrs. Dunlee understood it all now. Jimmy's
head was clear enough; he knew perfectly
well what he was talking about. The
watch was gone, a very valuable one. Search
must be made for it at once. Without waiting
to speak to her husband, Mrs. Dunlee put
on her hat and went with Jimmy up the hill.
He limped a little from the bruise of his fall
and she steadied him with her arm as they
walked.</p>

<h2>&quot;CHICKEN LITTLE&quot; AND JOE</h2>


<p>The man and woman who lived in the
green cottage had gone to a neighbor's to
stay till their chimney should be fastened on
again. There was no one in sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Here's the place where I went up,&quot; said
Jimmy, laying his hand on one of the ridge-poles.
&quot;And here's the place where I came
down,&quot; pointing to another ridge-pole.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee was stooping and looking around
carefully. There was not a tuft of grass or a
clump of weeds behind which even a small
article could be hidden, much less a large
bright object like a gold watch. She took a
wooden pencil from her pocket and scraped
the earth with it; but only disturbed a few
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" />ants and beetles. If the watch had ever been
dropped here, it certainly was not here now.
She and Jimmy turned and walked home in
the twilight,&mdash;or as Mrs. McQuilken called
it, &quot;the dimmets,&quot; and poor Jimmy drew a
cloud of gloom about him like a cloak.</p>

<p>They looked on the ground at every step
of the way.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a piece of chaparral over there.
Did you go through that?&quot; asked Mrs.
Dunlee.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I never, I'm sure I never. I walked
in the road right straight along. Oh,
mamma, if I've lost that watch 'twill break
my heart. But I'll pay papa for it, you see
if I don't! I'll save every penny I get and
put it together and pay papa!&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee did not reply for a moment;
she took time to reflect. Jimmy was a dear
boy, but very heedless. He had done wrong
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" />in the first place to take the watch from
Lucy without his father's permission. He
must be taught to respect other people's
property and other people's rights. He must
learn to think, and learn to be careful. Here
was a chance for a lesson.</p>

<p>&quot;Jamie,&quot; said she at last, &quot;I am glad you
wish to atone for the wrong you have done;
it shows a proper spirit. I agree with you
that if the watch isn't found you ought to
give papa what you can toward paying for it.
That is no more than fair.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to, mamma, I just want to!&quot; burst
forth Jimmy. &quot;I wish I was little like Eddo,
before 'twas wrong for me to be naughty.&quot;</p>

<p>His mother took him in her arms and
kissed him, for he was so tired and miserable
that he could not keep the tears back
another moment.</p>

<p>Friday night passed and most of Saturday;
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" />and though diligent search was made, the
watch was not found.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor papa!&quot; said Kyzie. &quot;He doesn't
say much; but how sober he looks! Grandma
Dunlee gave him that watch, Jimmy, when he
was a young man; and he did love it so!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know it. Oh, dear, how can he stand
it?&quot; responded jimmy, who had been deeply
touched from the first by his father's forbearance.
&quot;Mr, Pollard punished Nate dreadfully,
you know; but here's Papa Dunlee,
why, he hasn't even scolded!&quot;</p>

<p>Papa Dunlee was a wise man. He saw
that his little son was suffering enough
already; he was learning a hard lesson, and
perhaps would learn it all the better for being
left alone with his own conscience.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon the boy was very disconsolate,
and Mr. Dunlee patted him on the
head, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" />Maybe we'll find the watch yet, my son.
And anyway, I know Jimmum didn't mean to
lose it.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he sat down to read, and Jimmy
gazed at him reverently. The sunshine about
his head seemed almost like a halo, and the
boy thought of the angels, and wondered if
they could possibly be any better than papa!</p>

<p>&quot;Papa is the best man! Never was cross
in his life. I should be cross as fury! I
should shake <i>my</i> boy all to pieces if he
should carry off my gold watch and drop it
in the sand!&quot;</p>

<p>Monday morning came and the missing
article did not appear. Everybody looked
troubled. Edith walked about, carrying her
lame kitten in a basket, and saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Zee is getting better all the while, but
how can I be happy when papa's watch is
lost!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" />Who knows but I shall be the one to
find it?&quot; returned Katharine with a mysterious
smile, as she was leaving the house.</p>

<p>&quot;You forgot to tell us, and we forgot to
ask you, How do you like your school?&quot;
said Aunt Vi.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, ever so much, auntie. I'm making it
just as old-fashioned as I can. I'm going to
write Grandma Parlin this week and ask her
if what I do is old-fashioned enough. Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy was waiting for her down the path.</p>

<p>&quot;What makes you think you'll find the
watch, Kyzie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I don't know, myself, what I meant.
I just said it for fun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, do you think Joe Rolfe has got it,
or Chicken Little? That's what I want to
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hush, Jimmy! Papa wouldn't allow you
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" />to speak names in that way. Somebody stole
it, I suppose, but we don't know who it
was.&quot;</p>

<p>Still Kyzie's face wore a stern look that
morning. It was a thing not to be spoken
of, but she had resolved to &quot;keep an eye&quot;
on two or three of the boys, and see if there
was anything peculiar in their appearance.
Should one of them blush or turn pale when
spoken to, it would be a sure sign of guilt,
and she should go home and announce with
triumph to her father:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Papa, I've found out the thief!&quot;</p>

<p>The scholars all appeared pretty much as
usual; raising their hands very often to ask,
&quot;May I speak?&quot; or, &quot;May I have a drink of
water?&quot; The little teacher had always wished
they would not do so, but how could she help
it? It was &quot;an old-fashioned school,&quot; perhaps
that was why it was so noisy. Whatever went
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" />wrong, Kyzie always said to herself, &quot;Oh, it's
just an old-fashioned school.&quot;</p>

<p>Nate Pollard and Jimmy sat to-day as far
apart as possible, almost turning their backs
upon each other. At the bottom of his heart
Nate was truly ashamed of himself, though he
would not have owned it. There were five
new scholars, and Katharine wrote down their
names with much pride. Best of all, some of
the children really seemed to be trying to get
their lessons.</p>

<p>She had never known Joe Rolfe to study
like this. &quot;Is it because he is guilty?&quot;
thought the little teacher watching him from
under her eyebrows. She walked along toward
him so softly that he did not hear her footsteps.</p>

<p>&quot;Joseph!&quot; she exclaimed, suddenly. Her
voice startled him; he looked up in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad to see you studying, Joseph.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" />Did he blush? His face was of a brownish
red hue at any time, being much tanned; she
could not be quite sure of the blush. But
why did he look so sober? Children generally
smile when they are praised.</p>

<p>She had been to Bab and Lucy and said,
&quot;How still you are, darlings!&quot; and they had
seemed delighted.</p>

<p>Next she tried Chicken Little. He certainly
jumped when she spoke his name close
to his ear, &quot;Henry.&quot; Now why should he
jump and seem so confused unless he knew
he had done something wrong? She forgot
that he was a very timid boy.</p>

<p>&quot;Henry, what is the matter with you?&quot; she
asked, frowning severely.</p>

<p>She had never frowned on him before, for
she liked the little fellow, and was trying her
best to &quot;make a man of him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the matter, Henry?&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" />By this time he was scared nearly out of
his wits, and stole a side glance at her to see
if she had a switch in her hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't whip me,&quot; he pleaded in a trembling
voice. &quot;Don't whip me, teacher; and
I'll give you f-i-v-e thousand dollars!&quot;</p>

<p>As he offered this modest sum to save
himself from her wrath, the little teacher
nearly laughed aloud, Henry did not know
it, however; her face was hidden behind a
book.</p>

<p>&quot;What made you think, you silly boy, that
I was going to punish you?&quot; she asked as
soon as she could find her voice. &quot;Have
you done something wicked?&quot;</p>

<p>She spoke in a low tone for his ear alone,
but he writhed under it as if it had been a
blow.</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;don'&mdash;know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is the thief,&quot; thought Kyzie. &quot;Oh,<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" />
Henry, if you've done something wrong you
must know it. Tell me what it was.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;can't!&quot;</p>

<p>She put her lips nearer his ear. &quot;Was it
you and Joseph Rolfe together? Perhaps
you <i>both</i> did something wicked?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;don'&mdash;know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was it last Friday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&mdash;don'&mdash;know!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will you tell me after school?&quot;</p>

<p>Henry was unable to answer. Worn out
with contending emotions he put his head
down on the seat and cried.</p>

<p>This did not seem like innocence. Joseph
Rolfe was looking on from across the aisle,
as if he wished very much to know what
she and Henry were talking about.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll make them tell me the whole
story, the wicked boys,&quot; thought Kyzie,
indignantly. &quot;But I can't hurry about it;<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" />
I must be very careful. I think I'll wait
till to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p>So she calmed herself and called out her
classes. Katharine was a &quot;golden girl,&quot; and
had a strong sense of justice. She would
say nothing yet to her father, for the boys
might possibly be innocent; still she went
home that afternoon feeling that she had
almost made a discovery.</p>

<p>&quot;Good evening, Grandmother Graymouse,&quot;
said Uncle James, as they were all seated
on the veranda after dinner, &quot;do I understand
that you are hunting for a watch?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm hunting for it, oh, yes,&quot; replied
Kyzie, trying not to look too triumphant;
&quot;but I haven't found it yet. Just wait till
to-morrow, Uncle James.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe we'll wait another minute!&quot;
declared Mr. Sanford, looking around with
a roguish smile. &quot;I see the Dunlee people
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" />are all here, Jimmum, Lucy, and all. Attention,
my friends! The thief has been
found!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What thief?&quot; asked Mrs. Hale and Mrs.
Dunlee.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, <i>the</i> thief! The one we're looking
for! The one that stole the watch!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really mean it?&quot; asked the ladies
again. &quot;Did he bring it back?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come and see,&quot; said Uncle James, leading
the way upstairs.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it's Joe Rolfe,&quot; thought Kyzie.
&quot;I suppose he was frightened by what I said
to Henry Small.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the thief in your room, Uncle James?&quot;
said Jimmy. &quot;Why didn't you put him in
jail?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Jimmum, do you think all thieves
ought to go to jail? I once knew a little
boy who stole a chimney right off a house;
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" />yet I never heard a word said about putting
<i>him</i> in jail!</p>

<p>&quot;But here we are at the chamber door.
Stand behind me, all of you, in single file.&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2>THE THIEF FOUND</h2>


<p>&quot;I don't know so much as I thought I
did,&quot; said Kyzie to herself. &quot;Joe Rolfe
wouldn't be in this room.&quot;</p>

<p>For Uncle James was knocking at the door
of Number Five.</p>

<p>&quot;Walk right in,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken,
coming to meet her guests. She had her
knitting in one hand. &quot;Come in, all of you.
Why, Mr. Templeton, are you here too? You
wouldn't have taken me into your house if
you'd known I was a thief; now would you,
Mr. Templeton?&quot;</p>

<p>And laughing, she put her right hand in
her apron pocket and drew out a gold watch
and chain.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" />If this belongs to anybody present, let
him step up and claim his property.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee came forward in amazement,
while Jimmy gave a little squeal of delight.</p>

<p>&quot;This is mine, thank you, madam,&quot; said
Mr. Dunlee, looking at the watch closely. It
seemed very much battered.</p>

<p>&quot;Dreadfully smashed up, isn't it, sir? I
can't tell you how sorry I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Dunlee shook it, and held it to his
ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it won't go,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken.
&quot;The inside seems worse off, if anything,
than the outside. 'Twill have to have new
works.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very likely. But it is so precious to me,
madam, that even in this condition I'm glad
to get it back again. Pray, where has it
been?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right here in this room. Didn't you
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137" />understand me to confess to stealing it?
Why, you're shaking your head as if you
doubted my word.&quot;</p>

<p>They were all laughing now, and the old
lady's eyes twinkled with fun.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if I didn't steal it myself, one of my
family did, so it amounts to the same thing.
Come out here, you unprincipled girl, and beg
the gentleman's pardon,&quot; she added, kneeling
and dragging forth from under the bed a
beautiful bird.</p>

<p>It was her own magpie, chattering and
scolding.</p>

<p>&quot;Now tell the gentleman who stole his
watch? Speak up loud and clear!&quot;</p>

<p>The bird flapped her wings, and cawed out
very crossly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Mag! Mag! Mag!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear her! Hear that!&quot; cried her mistress.
&quot;So you did steal it, Mag&mdash;I'm glad
<a name="Page_138" id="Page_138" />to hear you tell the truth for once in your
life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she take the watch? Did she really
and truly?&quot; cried the children in chorus.</p>

<p>&quot;To be sure she did, the bad girl. She
has done such things before, and I have
always found her out; but this time she was
too sly for me. She went and put it in my
mending-basket; and who would have thought
of looking for it there?&quot;</p>

<p>Mag tipped her head to one side saucily,
and kept muttering to herself.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I happened to go to the basket this
afternoon and take up a pair of stockings to
mend. They felt amazingly heavy. There was
a hard wad in them, and I wondered what it
could be. I put in my hand and pulled out
the watch. Yes, 'twas tucked right into the
stockings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder we didn't any of us mistrust
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139" />her at the time of it,&quot; said Mr. Templeton;
&quot;those magpies are dreadful thieves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I suppose you thought 'twas my
business to take care of her, and it was. I'm
ashamed of myself,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken.
&quot;I was looking out of the window when the
boys shied over that roof, but my mind
wasn't on jewelry then. All I thought of was
to run and call for help.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, and it was her screams which had
aroused the whole neighborhood.</p>

<p>&quot;And at that very time my Mag was roaming
at large. No doubt she saw the watch
the moment it fell; and to use your expression,
Mr. Templeton, she jumped at it like a
dolphin at a silver spoon.&quot;</p>

<p>The landlord laughed. &quot;But the mystery is,&quot;
said he, &quot;how she got back to the house without
being seen. She must have been pretty spry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O Mag, Mag, to think I never once
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140" />thought to look after you!&quot; exclaimed Mrs.
McQuilken, penitently.</p>

<p>The bird was scolding all the while, and
running about with short, jerky movements,
trying her best to get out of the room; but
the door was closed.</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty thing,&quot; said Edith. &quot;What a shame
she should be a thief!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is pretty, now isn't she?&quot; returned
her mistress, fondly. &quot;My husband brought
her from China. You don't often see a
Chinese magpie, with blue plumage,&mdash;cobalt
blue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's a perfect oddity,&quot; said Mrs. Hale.
&quot;See those two centre tail-feathers, so very
long, barred with black and tipped with
white.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Dunlee, &quot;and the red bill
and red legs. She's a brilliant creature, Mrs.
McQuilken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_141" id="Page_141" />Well, you'll try to forgive her, won't you,
sir? I mean to bring her up as well as I
know how; but what are you going to do
with a girl that can't sense the ten commandments?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What indeed!&quot; laughed Mr. Dunlee.</p>

<p>&quot;You see she's naturally light-fingered. Yes,
you are, Mag, you needn't deny it. Those
red claws of yours are just pickers and
stealers.&quot;</p>

<p>Here Edith called attention to Mag's nest
on the wall, and they all admired it; and
Mrs. McQuilken said the canary liked to have
Mag near him at night, he was apt to be
lonesome.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish you'd come in the daytime,&quot; said
she. &quot;Come any and all of you, and hear
him sing. He does sing so sweetly, poor
blind thing; it's as good as a sermon to hear
him.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142" />On leaving Mrs. McQuilken the children
went to Aunt Vi's room and Jimmy kept
repeating joyously:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;We've found the watch, we've found the
watch!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Aunt Vi; &quot;but what a wreck
it is! Your papa will have to spend a deal
of money in repairing it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad!&quot; said Lucy, &quot;I 'spect 'twould
cost him cheaper to buy a new one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Twouldn't cost him so much; that's what
you mean,&quot; corrected Jimmy. &quot;But I'm
going to pay for mending it anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How can you?&quot; asked Kyzie. &quot;All you
have is just your tin box with silver in it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, but don't I keep having presents?
And can't I ask folks to stop giving me toys
and books and give me money? And they'll
do it every time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But that would be begging.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143" />Jimmy's face fell. Yes, on the whole it
did seem like begging. He had not thought
of that.</p>

<p>&quot;Why can't it ever snow in this country?&quot;
he exclaimed suddenly. &quot;Then I could shovel
it. That's the way boys make money 'back
East'&quot;</p>

<p>Then after a pause he burst forth again,
&quot;Or, I might pick berries&mdash;if there were
any berries!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not so very easy for little boys to earn
money; is it, dear?&quot; said Aunt Vi, putting
her arm around her young nephew and drawing
him toward her. &quot;But when they've done
wrong&mdash;you still think you did wrong, don't
you, Jimmy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He knows he did,&quot; broke in Lucy. &quot;My
papa lent me the watch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She wasn't talking to you,&quot; remonstrated
Jimmy. &quot;Yes, auntie, I did wrong; but<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144" />
Lucy needn't twit me of it! I won't be
<i>characteristic</i> any more as long as I live.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Vi smiled and patted his head lovingly.</p>

<p>&quot;No, dear, I think you'll be more thoughtful
in future. But now let us try to
think what can be done to pay for the
watch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll let him have some of the money I
get for teaching. I always meant to,&quot; said
Kyzie.</p>

<p>&quot;Very kind of you,&quot; returned Aunt Vi;
&quot;but we'll not take it if we can help it, will
we, Jimmy? I've been thinking it over for
some days, children; and a little plan has
occurred to me. Would you like to know
what it is?&quot;</p>

<p>They all looked interested. If Aunt Vi
had a plan, it was sure to be worth hearing.</p>

<p>&quot;It is this: mightn't we get up some
<a name="Page_145" id="Page_145" />entertainments,&mdash;good ones that would be
worth paying for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And sell the tickets? Oh, auntie, that's
just the thing! That's capital!&quot; cried Edith
and Kyzie. &quot;You'd do it beautifully.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure of that, girls. But we
might join together and act a little play that
I've been writing; that is, we might try.
What have you to say, Jimmy? Could you
help?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know. I can't speak pieces worth
a cent,&quot; replied the boy, writhing and shuffling
his feet. &quot;Look here!&quot; he said, brightening.
&quot;Don't you want some nails driven? I can
do that first rate.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Vi laughed and said nails might be
needed in putting up a staging, and she was
sure that he could use a hammer better than
she could.</p>

<p>Jimmy-boy, much gratified, struck an atti<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146" />tude,
and pounding his left palm with his
thumb, repeated the rhyme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Drive the nail straight, boys,<br /></span>
<span>Hit it on the head;<br /></span>
<span>Work with your might, boys,<br /></span>
<span>Ere the day has fled.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;There, he can speak, I knew he could
speak!&quot; cried Lucy, in admiration.</p>

<p>It was settled that they were all to meet
Wednesday morning, and their mother with
them, to talk over the matter.</p>

<p>&quot;That's great,&quot; said Jimmy.</p>

<p>The watch was found and the world looked
bright once more. True, he was deeply in
debt; but with such a grand helper as Aunt
Vi he was sure the debt would very soon be
paid.</p>

<h2>BEGGING PARDON</h2>


<p>Next morning Jimmy walked to school
with &quot;the little two,&quot; whistling as he went.
Lucy had tortured her hair into a &quot;cue,&quot;
and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;The happy wind upon her played,<br /></span>
<span>Blowing the ringlet from the braid.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;I've got the snarling-est, flying-est hair,&quot;
scolded she. &quot;I never'll braid it again as
long as I live; so there!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good!&quot; cried Jimmy. &quot;It has looked
like fury ever since we came up here.&quot;</p>

<p>Here Nate overtook the children. He had
not been very social since the accident, but
seemed now to want to talk.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_148" id="Page_148" />How do you do, Jimmy?&quot; he said: and
Jimmy responded, &quot;How d'ye do yourself?&quot;</p>

<p>The little girls ran on in advance, and
Jimmy would have joined them, but Nate
said:&mdash;-</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on! What's your hurry?&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy turned then and saw that Nate was
scowling and twisting his watch-chain.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got something to say to you&mdash;I
mean papa wants me to say something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh ho!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see any need of it, but papa says
I must.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy waited, curious to hear what was
coming.</p>

<p>&quot;Papa says I jollied you the other day.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, fooled you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you did, Nate Pollard, and 'twas
awful mean.&quot;</p>

<div class="center">
<a name='illus-160' id='illus-160'></a>
<img src="images/illus-160.jpg"
alt="&quot;'James S. Dunlee, will&mdash;you&mdash;forgive me?'&quot;"
title="&quot;'James S. Dunlee, will&mdash;you&mdash;forgive me?'&quot;" />
<h4><b>"'James S. Dunlee, will you forgive me?'"</b></h4>
</div>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_149" id="Page_149" />It wasn't either. What made you climb
that ridge-pole? You needn't have done it
just because I did. But papa says I've got
to&mdash;to&mdash;ask your pardon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm! I should think you'd better!
Tore my clothes to pieces. Smashed a gold
watch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You hadn't any business taking that
watch.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>&quot;Look here, Jimmy Dunlee, why don't
you speak?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haven't anything to say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't you say, 'I forgive you'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I can't. You never asked me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I ask you now. James S. Dunlee,
will&mdash;you&mdash;forgive me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H'm! I suppose I'll have to,&quot; replied
Jimmy, firing a pebble at nothing in particular.
&quot;I forgive you all right because we've
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150" />found the watch. If we hadn't found it, I
wouldn't! But don't you 'jolly' me again,
Nate Pollard, or you'll catch it!&quot;</p>

<p>This did not sound very forgiving; but
neither had Nate's remark sounded very penitent.
Nate smiled good-naturedly and seemed
satisfied. The fact was, he and Jimmy were
both of them trying, after the manner of boys,
to hide their real feelings. Nate knew that
his conduct had been very shabby and contemptible,
and he was ashamed of it, but did
not like to say so. Jimmy, for his part, was
glad to make up, but did not wish to seem
too glad.</p>

<p>Then they each tried to think of something
else to say. They were fully agreed that
they had talked long enough about their foolish
quarrel and would never allude to it
again.</p>

<p>&quot;Glad that watch has come,&quot; said Nate.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_151" id="Page_151" />So am I. It has come, but it won't <i>go</i>,&quot;
said Jimmy. And they laughed as if this
were a great joke.</p>

<p>Next Jimmy inquired about &quot;the colonel,&quot;
and Nate asked: &quot;What colonel? Oh, you
mean the mining engineer. He'll be here
next week with his men.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time the boys were feeling so friendly
that Jimmy asked Nate to go with him before
school next morning to see the knitting-woman's
pets and hear the blind canary sing.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you suppose the magpie will be there?&quot;
returned Nate. &quot;I want to catch her some
time and wring her old neck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wish you would,&quot; said Jimmy. &quot;Hello,
there's Chicken Little crying again. He's
more of a baby than our Eddo.&quot;</p>

<p>Henry was crying now because Dave Blake
had called him a coward. So very, very
unjust! He stood near the schoolhouse door,
<a name="Page_152" id="Page_152" />wiping his eyes on his checked apron and
saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go tell the teacher, Dave Blake!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, go along and tell her then. Fie,
for shame!&quot;</p>

<p>Henry, a feeble, petted child, was always
falling into trouble and always threatening to
tell the teacher. Kyzie considered him very
tiresome; but to-day when he came to her
with his tale of woe, she listened patiently,
because she had done him a wrong and wished
to atone for it. She had &quot;really and truly&quot;
suspected this simple child of a crime! He
would not take so much as a pin without
leave; neither would Joseph Rolfe. Yet in
her heart she had been accusing these innocent
children of stealing her father's watch!</p>

<p>&quot;Miserable me!&quot; thought Kyzie. &quot;I must
be very good to both of them now, to make
up for my dreadful injustice!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153" />She went to Joe and sweetly offered to
lend him her knife to whittle his lead pencil.
He looked surprised. He did not know she
had ever wronged him in her heart.</p>

<p>She wiped Henry's eyes on her own pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor little cry-baby!&quot; thought she. &quot;I
told my mother I would try to make a man
of him, and now I mean to begin.&quot;</p>

<p>She walked part of the way home with
him that afternoon. He considered it a great
honor. She looked like a little girl, but her
wish to help the child made her feel quite
grown-up and very wise.</p>

<p>&quot;Henry,&quot; said she, &quot;how nice you look
when you are not crying. Why, now you're
smiling, and you look like a darling!&quot;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;There! laugh again. I want to tell you
something, Henry. You'd be a great deal
<a name="Page_154" id="Page_154" />happier if you didn't cry so much; do you
know it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Miss Dunlee,&quot;&mdash;Kyzie liked extremely
to be called Miss Dunlee,&mdash;&quot;well,
Miss Dunlee, you see, the boys keep a-plaguing
me. And when they plague me I have to
cry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fie, don't you do it! If I were a
little black-eyed boy about your age I'd laugh,
and I'd say to those boys: 'You needn't try
to plague me; you just can't do it. The
more you try, the more I'll laugh.'&quot;</p>

<p>Henry's eyes opened wide in surprise, and
he laughed before he knew it.</p>

<p>&quot;There! that's the way, Henry. If you do
that they'll stop right off. There's no fun
in plaguing a little boy that laughs.&quot;</p>

<p>Henry laughed again and threw back his
shoulders. Why, this was something new.
This wasn't the way his mamma talked to
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155" />him. She always said, &quot;Mamma's boy is
sick and mustn't be plagued.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Another thing,&quot; went on the little girl,
pleased to see that her words had had some
effect; &quot;whatever else you may do, Henry,
<i>don't</i> 'run and tell,' Do you suppose George
Washington ever crept along to his teacher,
rubbing his eyes this way on his jacket
sleeve, and said 'Miss Dunlee&mdash;ah, the boys
have been a-making fun of me&mdash;ah! They
called me names, they did!'&quot;</p>

<p>Henry dropped his chin into his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind! You're a good little boy,
after all. <i>You</i> wouldn't steal anything, would
you, Henry?&quot;</p>

<p>This sudden question was naturally rather
startling. He had no answer ready.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know you wouldn't! But sometimes
little <i>birds</i> steal. Did you hear that a
magpie stole a watch the other day?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156" />Yes, I heard.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, here's some candy for you, Henry.&quot;</p>

<p>The boy held out his hand eagerly, though
looking rather bewildered. Was the candy
given because George Washington didn't &quot;run
and tell&quot;? Or because magpies steal watches?</p>

<p>&quot;Now, good night, Henry, and don't forget
what: I've been saying to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Henry walked on, feeling somewhat ashamed,
but enjoying the candy nevertheless. If his
pretty teacher didn't want him to tell tales, he
wouldn't do it any more. He would act just
like George Washington; and then how would
the big boys feel?</p>

<p>He did not forget his resolve. Next morning
when Dave Blake ran out his tongue
at him and Joe Rolfe said, &quot;Got any chickens
to sell?&quot; he laughed with all his might,
just to see how it would seem. Both
the boys stared; they didn't understand it.<a name="Page_157" id="Page_157" />
&quot;Hello, Chicken Little, what's the matter with
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Henry could see the eyes of his young
teacher twinkling from between the slats of
the window-blinds, and he spoke up with a
courage quite unheard-of:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing's the matter with <i>me!</i>&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear that chicken,&quot; cried Joe Rolfe.
&quot;He's beginning to crow!&quot;</p>

<p>Henry felt the tears starting; but as Miss
Katharine at that moment opened the blind
far enough to shake her finger at him privately
he thought better of it, and faltered
out:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;See here, boys, I like to be called Chicken
Little first rate! Say it again. Say it fi-ive
thousand times if you want to!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you're too willing,&quot; said Joe. &quot;We'll
try it some other time when you get over
being so willing!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158" />The bell rang; it sounded to Henry like
a peal of joy. He walked in in triumph, and
as he passed by the little teacher she patted
him on the head. She did not need to wipe
his eyes with her handkerchief, there were
no tears to be seen. He was not a brave
boy yet by any means, but he had made a
beginning; yes, that very morning he had
made a beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you tease Henry Small any more,
I don't like it at all,&quot; said Katharine to
Joseph Rolfe.</p>

<p>And then she slipped a paper of choice
candy into Joe's hand, charging him &quot;not to
eat it in school, now remember.&quot; It was a
queer thing to do; but then this was a queer
school; and besides Kyzie had her own reasons
for thinking she ought to be very kind
to Joe.</p>

<p>&quot;How silly I was to suspect those little
<a name="Page_159" id="Page_159" />boys! I'm afraid I never shall have much
judgment. Still, on the whole, I believe I'm
doing pretty well,&quot; thought she, looking
proudly at Henry Small's bright face, and
remembering too how Mr. Pollard had told
her that very morning that his son Nate was
learning more arithmetic at her little school
than he had ever learned in the city schools.
&quot;Oh, I'm so glad,&quot; mused the little teacher.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee thought Kyzie did not get
time enough for play. And just now the
little girl was unusually busy. They were
talking at home of the new entertainment to
be given for Jimmy-boy's benefit, and she
was to act a part in it as well as Edith. It
was &quot;Jimmy's play,&quot; but Jimmy was not to
appear in it at all. Kyzie and Edith together
were to print the tickets with a pen. The
white pasteboard had been cut into strips for
this purpose; but as it was not decided yet
<a name="Page_160" id="Page_160" />whether the play would be enacted on the
tailings or in the schoolhouse, the young
printers had got no farther than to print
these words very neatly at the bottom of the
tickets:</p>

<p>&quot;ADMIT THE BEARER.&quot;</p>

<h2>&quot;THE LITTLE SCHOOLMA'AM'S EARTHQUAKE&quot;</h2>


<p>There were only ten days in which to prepare
for the play called &quot;Granny's Quilting.&quot;
The children met Wednesday morning in
Aunt Vi's room, all but Bab, who was off
riding. So unfortunate, Lucy thought; for
how could any plans be made without Bab?</p>

<p>The play was very old-fashioned, requiring
four people, all clad in the style of one hundred
and fifty years ago. Uncle James would
wear a gray wig and &quot;small clothes&quot; and
personate &quot;Grandsir Whalen&quot;; Kyzie Dunlee,
Grandsir's old wife, in white cap, &quot;short gown,&quot;
and petticoat, was to be &quot;Granny Whalen&quot;
of course.</p>

<p>A grandson and granddaughter were needed
<a name="Page_162" id="Page_162" />for this aged couple. Edith would make a
lovely granddaughter and pretend to spin flax.
Who would play the grandson and shell the
corn? Jimmy thought Nate Pollard was just
the one, he was &quot;so good at speaking pieces.&quot;
They decided to ask Nate at once, and have
that matter settled.</p>

<p>Aunt Vi showed a collection of articles which
&quot;the knitting-woman&quot; had kindly offered
for their use; a three-legged light stand,
two fiddle-backed chairs, and a very old hour-glass.</p>

<p>&quot;I should call it a pair of glasses,&quot; said
Edith, as they watched the sand drip slowly
from one glass into the other.</p>

<p>Aunt Vi said it took exactly an hour for
it to drain out, and our forefathers used to
tell the time of day by hour-glasses before
clocks were invented.</p>

<p>&quot;What <i>are</i> forefathers?&quot; Lucy asked Edith.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_163" id="Page_163" />Oh, Adam and Eve and all those old
people,&quot; was the careless reply.</p>

<p>&quot;And didn't they have any clocks?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course not. What do you suppose?&quot;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Nate had
come to find Jimmy and go with him to see
the blind canary.</p>

<p>&quot;We were just talking about you,&quot; said
Aunt Vi. &quot;Are you willing to be Katharine's
grandson in the play?&quot;</p>

<p>Nate replied laughing that he would do
whatever was wanted of him, and he could
send home and get some knee-buckles and
a cocked hat.</p>

<p>Aunt Vi said &quot;Capital!&quot; and gave Jimmy
a look which said, &quot;Everything seems to be
going on famously for our new play.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmy led the way to Mrs. McQuilken's
room, his face wreathed with smiles.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, good morning; how do you all do?&quot;<a name="Page_164" id="Page_164" />
said the lady, meeting the children with courteous
smiles.&quot; I see you've brought your
kitten, Edith.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am; will you please look at her
wounds again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They are pretty well healed, dear. I've
never felt much concerned about Zee's wounds.
She makes believe half of her sufferings for
the sake of being petted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does she, though? I'm so glad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; that 'prize tail' will soon be waving
as proudly as ever. But I suppose you all
came to see the canary. Mag, you naughty
girl,&quot; she added, turning to the magpie,
&quot;hide under the bed. They didn't come to
see you. Here, Job, you are the one that's
wanted.&quot;</p>

<p>Little Job, the canary, was standing on the
rug. He came forward now to greet his
visitors, putting out a foot to feel his way,
<a name="Page_165" id="Page_165" />like a blind man with a cane. Then he began
to sing joyously.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you call that good music?&quot; asked
his mistress, knitting as she spoke. &quot;He came
from Germany; there's where you get the
best singers. Some canaries won't sing before
company and some won't sing alone; they
are fussy,&mdash;I call it <i>pernickitty</i>. Why, I
had one with a voice like a flute; but I happened
to buy some new wall-paper, and she
didn't like the looks of it, and after that she
never would sing a note.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you in earnest?&quot; asked Kyzie.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's a fact. But Job never was pernickitty,
bless his little heart!&quot;</p>

<p>She brought a tiny bell and let him take
it in his claws.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, I'll go out of the room, and you
all keep still and see if he'll ring to call me
back.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166" />She went, closing the door after her. No
one spoke. Job moved his head from side
to side, and, apparently making up his little
mind that he was all alone, he shook the bell
peal after peal. Presently his mistress appeared.
&quot;Did you think mamma had gone
and left you, Job darling? Mamma can't
stay away from her baby.&quot;</p>

<p>The cooing tone pleased the little creature, and
he sang again even more sweetly than before.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me show you another of his tricks.
You see this little gun? Well, when he fires
it off that will be the end of poor Job!&quot;</p>

<p>The gun was about two inches long and as
large around as a lead pencil. Inside was a
tiny spring; and when Job's claw touched the
spring the gun went off with a loud report.
Job fell over at once as if shot and lay
perfectly still and stiff on the rug. Lucy
screamed out:&mdash;-</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167" />Oh, I'm so sorry he is dead!&quot;</p>

<p>But next moment he roused himself and
sat up and shook his feathers as if he
relished the joke.</p>

<p>The children had a delightful half hour
with the captain's widow and her pets; only
Lucy could not be satisfied because Bab was
away.</p>

<p>&quot;Too bad you went off riding yesterday,&quot;
said she as they sat next morning playing
with their dolls. &quot;You never saw that blind
canary that shoots himself, and comes to life
and rings a bell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But can't I see him sometime, Auntie
Lucy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can, oh, yes, and I'll go with you.
But, Bab, you ought to have heard our talk
about the play! Kyzie is going to be as
much as a hundred years old, and I guess
Uncle James will be a hundred and fifty.<a name="Page_168" id="Page_168" />
And they've got a pair of old glasses with
sand inside&mdash;the same kind that Adam and
Eve used to have.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why-ee! Did Adam and Eve wear
glasses? 'Tisn't in their pictures; <i>I</i> never saw
'em with glasses on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, I don't mean glasses <i>wear</i>! I
said glasses with sand inside; <i>that's</i> what
Uncle James has got. Runs out every hour.
Sits on the table.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know what you mean, auntie! You
mean an <i>hour-glass!</i> Grandpa Hale has one
and I've seen lots of 'em in France.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy felt humbled. Though pretending to
be Bab's aunt, she often found that her little
niece knew more than she knew herself!</p>

<p>&quot;Seems queer about Adam and Eve,&quot; said
she, hastening to change the subject; &quot;who
do you s'pose took care of 'em when they
were little babies?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_169" id="Page_169" />Why, Auntie Lucy, there wasn't ever any
<i>babiness</i> about Adam and Eve! Don't you
remember, they stayed just exactly as they
were made!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, so they did. I forgot.&quot;</p>

<p>Lucy had made another mistake. This
was not like a &quot;truly auntie&quot;; still it did
not matter so very much, for Bab never
laughed at her and they loved each other
&quot;dearilee.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know a great many things, don't
you, Bab? And <i>I</i> keep forgetting 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I know all about the world and the
garden of Eden; <i>that's</i> easy enough,&quot; replied
the wise niece.</p>

<p>And then they went back to their dolls.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Kyzie Dunlee was
standing in the schoolhouse door with a group
of children about her when Nate Pollard
appeared. As he looked at her he remem<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170" />bered
&quot;Jimmy's play,&quot; and the parts they were
both to take in it; and the thought of little
Kyzie as his poor old grandmother seemed
so funny to Nate that he began to laugh and
called out, &quot;Good morning, grandmother!&quot;</p>

<p>He meant no harm; but Kyzie thought
him very disrespectful to accost her in that
way before the children, and she tossed her
head without answering him.</p>

<p>Nate was angry. How polite he had always
been to her, never telling her what a
queer school she kept! And now that he
had consented to be her grandson in Jimmy's
play, just to please her and the rest of the
family, it did seem as if she needn't put on
airs in this way!</p>

<p>&quot;Ahem!&quot; said he; &quot;did you hear about
that dreadful earthquake in San Diego?&quot;</p>

<p>There had been a very slight one, but he
was trying to tease her.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_171" id="Page_171" />No, oh, no!&quot; she replied, throwing up
both hands. &quot;When was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Last night. I'm afraid of 'em myself,
and if we get one here to-day you needn't
be surprised to see me cut and run right
out of the schoolhouse.&quot;</p>

<p>The children looked at him in alarm. Kyzie
could not allow this.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you wouldn't do that!&quot; said she, with
another toss of the head. &quot;Before I'd run
away from an earthquake! Besides, what
good would it do?&quot;</p>

<p>By afternoon the news had spread about
among the children that there was to be a
terrible earthquake that day. They huddled
together like frightened lambs. The little
teacher, wishing to reassure them, planted
herself against the wall, and made what Edith
would have called a &quot;little preach.&quot;</p>

<p>She pointed out of the window to the clear
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172" />sky and said she &quot;could not see the least
sign of an earthquake.&quot; But even if one
should come they need not be afraid, for
their heavenly Father would take care of
them.</p>

<p>&quot;And you mustn't think for a moment of
running away! No, children, be quiet! Look
at me, <i>I</i> am quiet. I wouldn't run away
if there were fifty earthquakes!&quot;</p>

<p>Strange to say, she had hardly spoken these
words when the house began to shake! They
all knew too well what it meant, that frightful
rocking and rumbling; the ground was
opening under their feet!</p>

<p>Kyzie, though she may have feared it
vaguely all along, was taken entirely by surprise,
and did&mdash;what do you think? As
quick as a flash, without waiting for a second
thought, she turned and jumped out of the
window!</p>

<p><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173" />Next moment, remembering the children,
she screamed for them to follow her, and
they poured out of the house, some by the
window, some by the door, all shrieking like
mad.</p>

<p>It was a wild scene,&mdash;the frantic teacher,
the terrified children,&mdash;and Kyzie will never
cease to blush every time she recalls it. For
there was no earthquake after all! It was
only the new &quot;colonel&quot; and his men blasting
a rock in the mine!</p>

<p>Of course this escapade of the young teacher
amused the people of Castle Cliff immensely.
They called it &quot;the little schoolma'am's earthquake&quot;;
and the little schoolma'am heard
of it and almost wished it had been a real
earthquake and had swallowed her up.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Papa Dunlee! Oh, Mamma Dunlee!&quot;
she cried, her cheeks crimson, her eyelids
swollen from weeping. &quot;I keep finding out
<a name="Page_174" id="Page_174" />that I'm not half so much of a girl as I
thought I was! What does make me do such
ridiculous things?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are only very young, you dear child,&quot;
replied her parents.</p>

<p>They pitied her sincerely and did their
best to console her. But they were wise
people, and perhaps they knew that their
eldest daughter needed to be humbled just a
little. It was hard, very hard, yet sometimes
it is the hard things which do us most good.</p>

<p>&quot;O mamma, don't ask me to go down to
dinner. I can't, I can't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No indeed, darling, your dinner shall be
sent up to you. What would you like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No matter what, mamma&mdash;I don't care
for eating. I can't ever hold up my head
any more. And as for going into that school
again, I never, never, never will do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you will, my daughter,&quot; said Mr.<a name="Page_175" id="Page_175" />
Dunlee, quietly. &quot;I think you'll go back and
live this down and 'twill soon be all forgotten.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O papa, do you really, really think 'twill
ever be forgotten? Do you think so, mamma?
A silly, disgraceful, foolish, outrageous, abominable,&mdash;there,
I can't find words bad enough!&quot;</p>

<p>As her parents were leaving the room she
revived a little and added:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Remember, mamma, just soup and chicken
and celery. But a full saucer of ice-cream.
I hope 'twill be vanilla.&quot;</p>

<h2>NATE'S CAVE</h2>


<p>The little teacher went back to her school
the very next day. It was a hard thing, but
she knew her parents desired it. Her proud
head was lowered; she could not meet the
eyes of the children, who seemed to be trying
their best not to laugh. At last she spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I got frightened yesterday. I was not
very brave; now was I? Hark! The people
in the mine are blasting rocks again, but we
won't run away, will we?&quot;</p>

<p>They laughed, and she tried to laugh, too.
Then she called the classes into the floor;
and no more did she ever say to the scholars
about the earthquake. She helped Nate in
his arithmetic, and he treated her like a
<a name="Page_177" id="Page_177" />queen. He was coming to Aunt Vi's room
that evening to show his knee-buckles and
cocked hat and find out just what he was to
do on the stage.</p>

<p>Kyzie wanted to see the cocked hat and
felt interested in her own white cap which
Mrs. McQuilken was making. It was a good
thing for Katharine that she had &quot;Jimmy's
play&quot; to think of just now. It helped her
through that long forenoon. After this the
forenoons did not drag; school went on as
usual, and Kyzie was glad she had had the
courage to go back and &quot;live down&quot; her
foolish behavior.</p>

<p>When they met in Aunt Vi's room that
evening it was decided not to have &quot;Jimmy's
play&quot; on the tailings, for that was a place
free to all. People would not buy tickets for
an entertainment out of doors.</p>

<p>&quot;My tent is the thing,&quot; said Uncle James,
<a name="Page_178" id="Page_178" />and so they all thought It was a large
white one, and the children agreed to decorate
it with evergreens. It would hold all the
people who were likely to come and many more.</p>

<p>During the week Uncle James set up the
tent not far from the hotel and in one corner
of it built a staging. He did not mind taking
trouble for his beloved namesake, James Sanford
Dunlee. The stage was made to look
like a room in an old-fashioned house. It
had a make-believe door and window and a
make-believe fireplace with andirons and wood
and shovel and tongs. There was a rag rug
on the floor, and on the three-legged stand
stood the hour-glass with candles in iron
candlesticks. The fiddle-backed chairs were
there and two <i>hard</i> &quot;easy-chairs&quot; and an
old wooden &quot;settle.&quot; Lucy and Bab said it
looked &quot;like somebody's house,&quot; and they
wanted to go and live in it.</p>

<p><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179" />On the Saturday afternoon appointed the
play had been well learned by the four actors.
Everything being ready, this cosy little sitting-room
was now shut off from view by a calico
curtain which was stretched across the stage
by long strings run through brass rings.</p>

<p>The play would begin at half-past two.
Jimmy was dressed neatly in his very best
clothes. He had a roll of paper and a pencil
in one of his pockets and during the play he
meant to add up the number of people present
and find out how much money had been
taken.</p>

<p>&quot;But Jimmy-boy, it won't be very much,&quot;
said Edith. &quot;This is an empty town, and so
queer too. Something may happen at the last
minute that will spoil the whole thing.&quot;</p>

<p>She was right. Something did happen which
no one could have foreseen. For an &quot;empty&quot;
town Castle Cliff was famous for events.</p>

<p><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180" />As Jimmy left the hotel just after luncheon
he overtook Nate Pollard and Joe Rolfe standing
near a big sand bank, talking together
earnestly.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Jimmum,&quot; said Nate; &quot;we've
got a spade for you. We're going to dig a
cave in the side of this bank.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the use of a cave?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, for one thing, we can run into it
in time of an earthquake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's so,&quot; said Jimmy. &quot;Or we could
stay in and be cave-dwellers.&quot;</p>

<p>But as he took up the spade he chanced to
look down at his new clothes. He had spoiled
one nice suit already and had promised his
mother he would be more careful of this one.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait till I put on my old clothes, will
you?&quot;</p>

<p>Nate laughed and snapped his fingers.
&quot;We're in a hurry. I've got to be in the
<a name="Page_181" id="Page_181" />tent in half an hour. Go along, you little
dude! We'll dig the cave without you.&quot;</p>

<p>The laugh cut Jimmy to the heart. And
he had been learning to like Nate so well.
A dude? Not he! Besides, what harm would
dry sand do? It's &quot;clean dirt.&quot;</p>

<p>Then all in a minute he thought of that
wild journey on the roof. It had made a
deeper impression upon him than any other
event of his life.</p>

<p>&quot;Poh! Am I going to dig dirt in my
best clothes just because Nate Pollard laughs
at me? I don't 'take stumps' any more;
there's no sense in it, so there!&quot;</p>

<p>And off he started, afraid to linger lest he
should fall into temptation. Jimmy might
be heedless, no doubt he often was; but when
he really stopped to think, he always respected
his mother's wishes and always kept his word
to her.</p>

<p><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182" />This was the trait in Jimmy which marked
him off as a highly bred little fellow. For let
me tell you, boys, respect for your elders is
the first point of high breeding all the world
over.</p>

<p>Jimmy sauntered on slowly toward the
door of the tent. There were a great many
benches inside, but it was not time yet for
the audience to arrive. Uncle James and
Katharine and Edith were on the stage, and
Aunt Vi was adding a few touches to Edith's
dress.</p>

<p>&quot;O dear,&quot; said Grandmamma Graymouse,
&quot;I hope I shan't forget my part. Tell me,
Uncle James, do I look old enough?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You look too old to be alive,&quot; he answered;
&quot;fifty years older than I do, certainly! Mrs.
Mehitable Whalen, are you my wife or my
very great grandmamma?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But where's Nate Pollard?&quot; Aunt Vi
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183" />asked. &quot;I told him to come early to rehearse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He said he'd be here in half an hour,&quot;
said Jimmy. &quot;He's off playing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I shall not have to punish my
young grandson,&quot; said Uncle James, solemnly,
as he began to peel a sycamore switch.</p>

<p>Uncle James's name was now &quot;Ichabod
Whalen,&quot; and he and &quot;Mehitable Whalen,&quot;
his wife, were such droll objects in their old-fashioned
clothes that they could not look at
each other without laughing.</p>

<p>Their absent grandson, &quot;Ezekiel Whalen&quot;
(or Nate Pollard), was a fine specimen of a
boy of ancient times, and Aunt Vi had been
much pleased with the way in which he acted
his part. But where was he? Aunt Vi and
the grandparents grew impatient. It was
now half-past two; people were flocking into
the tent; but the curtain could not rise, for
<a name="Page_184" id="Page_184" />nothing was yet to be seen of young Master
&quot;Ezekiel Whalen &quot; and his small clothes and
his cocked hat. The house was pretty well
filled; really there were far more people than
had been expected, Jimmy, with pencil and
paper in hand, was figuring up the grown
people and children, and multiplying these
numbers by twenty-five and by fifteen. When
he found that the sum amounted to nearly
nine dollars he almost whistled for joy.</p>

<p>But all this while the audience was waiting.
People looked around in surprise; the
Dimlee family grew more and more anxious.
Aunt Lucy pinched Bab and Bab pinched
Aunt Lucy.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were loud voices at the
entrance of the tent. The tent curtain was
pushed aside violently, and Mr. Templeton
and Mr. Rolfe rushed in exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Two boys lost! All hands to the rescue!&quot;</p>

<p><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185" />The people were on their feet in a moment
and there was a grand rush for the outside.
The panic, so it was said afterward, was
about equal to &quot;the little schoolma'am's earthquake.&quot;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h3><a name="XIV" id="XIV" /><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186" />XIV</h3>

<h2>JIMMY'S GOOD LUCK</h2>


<p>&quot;It's the Pollard and Rolfe boys,&quot; explained
Mr. Templeton.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho! I know where <i>they</i> are!&quot; cried
Jimmy, &quot;They're all right. They're only
digging a cave in the side of a sand-bank.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Show us where! Run as fast as you
can!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Rolfe and Mr. Pollard.
Mr. Pollard had been hunting for the last
half-hour. He knew Nate was deeply interested
in &quot;Jimmy's play&quot; and would not have
kept away from the tent unless something
unusual had happened.</p>

<p>Jimmy ran, followed by several men who
could not possibly keep up with him. But
when they all reached the sand-bank, where
<a name="Page_187" id="Page_187" />were the &quot;cave-dwellers&quot;? They had burrowed
in the sand till completely out of sight!</p>

<p>&quot;Hello! Where are you&quot;? screamed Jimmy.</p>

<p>There was no answer. In enlarging the
cave they had loosened the very dry earth,
and thus caused the roof over their heads to
fall in upon them, actually burying them as
far as their arm-pits! They tried to scream,
but their muffled voices could not be heard.
The &quot;cave&quot; looked like a great pile of sand
and nothing more. Nobody would have
dreamed that there was any one inside it if it
had not been for Jimmy's story.</p>

<p>&quot;Courage, boys, we're after you, we'll soon
have you out!&quot; said the men cheerily; though
how could they tell whether the boys heard
or not? Indeed, how did they know the boys
were still alive?</p>

<p>Two men went for shovels. The other
men, not waiting for them to come back
<a name="Page_188" id="Page_188" />thrust their arms into the bank and scooped
out the sand with their hands. The sand
was loose and they worked very fast. Before
the shovels arrived a moan was heard. At
any rate one of the boys was alive. And
before long they had unearthed both the
young prisoners and dragged them out of
the cave.</p>

<p>Not a minute too soon, Joe gasped for
breath and looked wildly about; but Nate
lay perfectly still; it could hardly be seen
at first that he breathed. His father and
mother, the doctor and plenty of other people
were ready and eager to help; but it
was some time before he showed signs of life.
When at last he opened his eyes the joy
of his parents was something touching to
witness.</p>

<p>Jimmy, who had been standing about with
the other children, watching and waiting,
<a name="Page_189" id="Page_189" />caught his mother by the sleeve and whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I should have been in there too, mamma,
if it hadn't been for you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean, my son? In that
cave? I never knew the boys were trying
to make a cave. I did not forbid your digging
in the sand, did I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, mamma; but I knew you wouldn't
want me to do it in these clothes&mdash;after all
my actions! And I had promised to be more
careful.&quot;</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlee smiled, but there were tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;How glad I am that my little boy respected
his mother's wishes,&quot; said she, stooping
to kiss his earnest face.</p>

<p>She dared not think what might have happened
if he had disregarded her wishes!</p>

<p>It was a time of rejoicing. Mr. Templeton
<a name="Page_190" id="Page_190" />ordered out the brass band and the Hindoo
tam tam. The horse Thistleblow seemed to
think he must be wanted too, and came and
danced in circles before the groups of happy
people.</p>

<p>&quot;I could believe I was in some foreign
country,&quot; said Mrs. McQuilken, smiling under
her East Indian puggaree, as she had not
been seen to smile before, and dropping a
kiss on the cheek of her favorite Edith.</p>

<p>After dinner the Dunlees met in Aunt Vi's
room, and Aunt Vi observed that Mrs. Dunlee
kept Jimmy close by her side, looking at
him in the way mothers look at good little
sons, her eyes shining with happy love and
pride.</p>

<p>They were talking over &quot;Jimmy's play,&quot;
which had not been played. The money must
all be given back to the people who had
sat and looked so long at that calico curtain.</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_191" id="Page_191" />We'll try 'Granny's Quilting' again next
Saturday,&quot; said Aunt Vi.</p>

<p>They did try it again. There were no
caves to dig this time, and young Master
&quot;Ezekiel Whalen&quot; was on the stage promptly
at half-past one, eager to show his grandparents
that he was a boy to be relied upon
after all. The play was a remarkable success.
All the &quot;summer boarders and campers&quot;
came to it, and everybody said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, do give us some more entertainments,
Mrs. Sanford! Let us have one every
Saturday.&quot;</p>

<p>Aunt Vi, being the kindest soul in the
world, promised to do what she could. She
gave the play of the &quot;Pied Piper of Hamelin,&quot;
with children for rats; and Eddo was
dressed as a mouse, and squealed so perfectly
that Edith's cat could hardly be restrained
from rushing headlong upon the stage.</p>

<p><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192" />Later there were tableaux. Edith wore
red, white, and blue and was the Goddess of
Liberty. Jimmy was a cowboy with cartridge-belt
and pistols. Lucy and Barbara were
Night and Morning, with stars on their heads.
Mr. Sanford was Uncle Jonathan. Mr. Hale
was an Indian chief.</p>

<p>Jimmy's debts were more than paid, and a
happier boy was not to be found in the state
of California.</p>

<p>After this there were plenty of free entertainments
on the tailings. At one of these,
when the audience was watching a flight of
rockets, Katharine heard two women not far
away talking together. One of them asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Where's that little Dunlee girl, the one
that keeps the play-school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over there in the corner,&quot; replied the
other, &quot;She hasn't any hat on. She's sitting
beside the girl with a cat in her lap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<a name="Page_193" id="Page_193" />Oh, is that the one? So young as that?
Well, she's a good girl, yes, she is. I
guess she <i>is</i> a good girl,&quot; said the first
speaker heartily. &quot;My little Henry thinks
there's nothing like her. He never learned
much of anything till he went to that play-school.
He never behaved so well as he
does now, never gave me so little trouble
at home. She's a <i>good</i> girl.&quot;</p>

<p>A world of comfort fell on Kyzie. Young
as she was and full of faults, she had really
done a wee bit of good.</p>

<p>&quot;And they didn't say a word about my jumping
out of the window,&quot; thought she, with
deep satisfaction. &quot;Wait till I grow up, just
wait till I grow up, and as true as I live I'll
be something and do something in this world!&quot;</p>

<p>She did not say this aloud, you may be
sure; but there was a look on her face of
high resolve.</p>

<p><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194" />Uncle James had often said to Aunt Vi:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Our Katharine is very much in earnest.
I know you agree with me that &quot;little Prudy's&quot;
eldest daughter is a golden girl!&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;play-school&quot; closed a few days later,
and it was Henry Small who received the
medal for good spelling. He wasn't so much
of a cry-baby nowadays and the boys had
stopped calling him &quot;Chicken Little.&quot;</p>

<p>The Dunlee party went home the last week
in August, declaring they had had delightful
times at Castle Cliff.</p>

<p>&quot;Only I never went down that mine in a
bucket,&quot; said Lucy. &quot;How could I when the
men were blowing up rocks just like an earthquake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I wanted to wait till they found that
vein,&quot; said Jimmy.</p>

<p>A few days before they left, Uncle James
went hunting and shot a deer. I wish there
<a name="Page_195" id="Page_195" />were space to tell of the barbecue to which
all the neighbors were invited a little later.</p>

<p>As it is, my young readers are not likely
to hear any more of the adventures of the
&quot;bonnie Dunlees,&quot; either at home or abroad.</p>

<p>But during their stay in the mountains that
summer Lucy begged Aunt Vi to write some
stories, with the little friends, Bab and Lucy,
for the heroines.</p>

<p>&quot;Some 'once-upon-a-time stories,' Auntie Vi.
Make believe we two girls go all about among
the fairies, just as Alice did in Wonderland;
only there are two of us together, and we
shall have a better time!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fie! How could I take real live little
girls into the kingdom of the elves and gnomes
and pixies? I shouldn't know how!&quot;</p>

<p>But she was so obliging as to try. The
week before they left for home she had completed
a book of &quot;once-upon-a-time stories,&quot;<a name="Page_196" id="Page_196" />
which she read aloud to all the children as
they clustered around her in the &quot;air-castle.&quot;
She called it &quot;Lucy in Fairyland,&quot; though
she meant Bab just as much as Lucy. If
the little public would like to see this book it
may be offered them by and by; together
with the comments which were made upon
each story by the whole Dunlee family,&mdash;Jimmy,
wee Lucy, and all.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
